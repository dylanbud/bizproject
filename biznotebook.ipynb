i\\'m having to walk through an accounts entire transaction history to figure it out we are not going to make it anon but we will avoid working until at least lmao. what the fuck based if true i\\'ve been working so i haven\\'t been paying much attention to what\\'s going on in the crypto space. i\\'m a proud keeper of some algorand though what\\'s algofi all about and what\\'s this about a dip coming? i still haven\\'t been able to make any money, the price of stbl hasn\\'t gone down enough for me to buy it and pay my stbl loan and profit. you are overestimating how woobly stbl is. feels good to get a villain win, stbl bobos eating steak tonight wth, i thought i had swapped the stbl to usdc at . but i just looked at it and it was actually at .. sorry for doubting you, schizo fren. why did i put my precious algos into adoge instead of akita when did you do that? adoge bled off like a month ago and has been relatively dead since then. why did you not exit it a month ago? it pisses me off that the team wasted their opportunity. can algorand become the new schizo coin and overthrow the xrp schizos? one day sell man, i\\'ll stay schizophrenic in the mean time why does it look worse tinychads now is our time finally, i\\'ve been bag holding ever since that verification pump. now $tiny will have some utility. hey! thats mine! dropping even further in the rankings as market cap slowly bleeds please god don\\'t summon them here with that fucking picture. you would have to be an absolute fucking moronic retard to put your algos back into governance tfw no hopium to be found. it\\'s really over, isn\\'t it? thanks, fren, you just restored my hope. i bought grand at . dollars. not buy anymore algo. i hate the algoenemy! i hate the algoenemy! a piece of shit like ada dominates the chart while you crawl around in the fucking mud like the pathetic worm coin you are. holy fuck that looks like shit new update is great imo! so many new features coming....wallet integration/trade history export for tax calc/charting features locked away to no-tiny users will be the big ones. dev said next months time frame iirc nothing but pure virgin rage /thread//# went from . to . in hours. bjjieqs i hate the antichrist! i guess algofi will be around for longer now. something like this right checked, that doesn\\'t look too bad nice work with the aws update. they were out of borrowing power so they had to roll out the staking contracts early... are they really trusting staking incentives to help keep the peg? lol how long can this last? it\\'s always fucking low. e anon please sell algo is going to . isn\\'t it? you might as well not get liquidated. gregor says the site will appear pink if you don\\'t hold at least tiny, hope you boys have your bags packed. or that you like pink. feelsgoodman.jpg wen tiny $????? korea is still accumulating checked, quads prove it it\\'s a bonds buy back until the lp staking is there today. this will decrease doomping further. eventually staking will have bank added, incentivizing staking without adding as much stbl into the market and in the end the stbl graph will look like the dai graph. slowly the ada holding fudders and gwei spending oldfags will get jealous of algorand. tinychart token convince me to not sell some tiny before the dump now is the dilemma. should we go full governance # or take more risks and go full yieldly this time... pes are getting a lot of hype but most of them are still shit. now give me either a decent game or a shit game with decent earnings you fuckers. wtf is going on with the liquidity. why am i a binance icp whale all of a sudden... here you go. i have another four digit stack in kucoin. nothing ever happens after all. cz, you motherfucker. lmao how much are you down anon thanks for helping out my mental health bro clean up the wagie wagies arent human that\\'s literally the same warehouse that voted against unionization just a few months ago. sheesh. lmao reagan really did a number on you burgers didnt he?

there was a christmas truce in between the germans and the english soldiers where they sung christmas songs together and left the trenches to play football with each other. this was much to the dismay of the commanders in charge. the soldiers even traded cigs and gifts they got from their loved ones such as chocolate or even scarfs. the next day a german came over to the other side of the trench and asked his new buddy if he still had the scarf. a british commander came and shot him in the face expecting a company to shut down any time it drizzles is beyond stupid. i don’t understand how you can be alive for any amount of time and not have experienced weather changing on a dime and forecasts being wrong. you have got to be . kindly fuck off back to r*ddit child i made it up public education is primarily funded by property taxes. i find it so funny when teachers bitch about pay when they get so much time off. if they want more pay why not raise a levy and convince the locality?

eccaacccceafdf that\\'s the idea with a cap on staking retard, we knew before the staking was live that there would be a million cap. better luck next time it\\'s not showing on smart chain, so no i don\\'t know where it is, maybe there is an error on the rubic site? so what happened? guy clicks swap on eth, his rbc is swapped for brbc, then the pool closes in that instant so it can\\'t be added to the pool and just sits in some team wallet? they didn\\'t code to refund in that circumstance? hows this pattern called piss off nonce, i have shown you that i have been screwed over while the devs keep quiet. on twitter there are others with the same problem as i have had, just read through the thread how we could not access the site at the start of the staking. the team fucked me here just like how they fucked me with algebra, or is that also paid fudding? there you go. ahh shit looks like its full then. i have all my shit on probit, where and how do i switch to to be ready for staking in q next year? well i hope i\\'m not losing my rubic with the cross chain, if i lose the gas then so be it. lmao k rubic privacy coin season has started ... without it being traced to my coinbase account?

it’s a literal bot, don’t respond to them. they have operators who manually check the status or effectiveness of some posts, sometimes they respond manually, but for the most part it’s literal ai that basically detects writing and sentiment patterns on boards or in this case, specific threads. ai will create a reply that includes common phrases to mimic a real peer in the community and then insert a comment about them receiving the jab or other subversive things. it is designed to make anons believe one of their like minded peers received the jab as well and to make themselves think maybe they should too. we are balls deep in the information warfare, we need to become literal paranoid schizophrenics to survive this future. exactly ;) can anyone translate what this says?

either way $ feels likely i threw $ into this the night rawsteakanon made the thread assuming it was just a pump and dump and it\\'s worth $ now. wish i woulda put in more. i should have believed. strip steaks tonight would it be better to buy near and swap that on rainbowbridge? do i have to pay eth fees either way? you can farm wnear-luna for tri now they have the pegging rate on the pc version. idk if it\\'s visible on mobile thank you /biz/ slurping right now it’s fun to have something pump in the short term instead of watching everything crab and dump any price targets for this? usd? $b fdv isn\\'t a conservative target but yes what\\'s going to happen this time? more evergrande fud? lockdown scares? omicron fearmongering? or maybe just a classic btc dump? look no further. rollin i\\'m getting my bonus in january, can you jews suppress the price for one more month please? maybe sirgay can recommence the dumps... why the fuck do we allow /smg/ to exist on this board they have trannies there? now im reassessing my thoughts... because it\\'s the only legitimate semblance of business and finance on this board. someone\\'s gotta make money. imagine being you, bro get rid of that fucking ear. t. /smg/ hell yeah bro, the crypto pits are always wailing, and we simply cannot stop winning at least they\\'re not /gme/ faggots slow and steady faggots. no point in getting rugged on tranny fem boy shit coin dog bonk sonic harry potter coins. sometimes ill swing eth or btc but i think the longest ive held it is like hours. it\\'s obvious jannies don\\'t care since there\\'s a non-stop flood of pajeet scam threads when the board isn\\'t going full meltdown with pink wojaks. it\\'s a containment thread for picrel mfw crypto faggot poorfucks think smg is the containment voard this is the face women make when i talk to them but they don’t know i have a fig net worth. even cashiers and waitresses make this face to me. i hate being ugly and rich, i wish i was a broke chad. fml you could get an year old sugar baby. find a girl who isn\\'t just a blonde bimbo, you can find someone you have things in common with like vidya or music. icp is being bought from other exchanges deaa watch the rocket go sky high kek is this why binance started offering .% interest on icp? it wasn\\'t on the flexible savings list for ages then suddenly it was recently. do i withdraw from binance? bullish, smells like a shakeout. nah i\\'ve had it saved for ages, before the moonman stuff showed up on /biz/. the icp moonman thing annoyed me because it was one of my favorite memes and now everyone thinks anyone posting it follows /biz/ insider stuff. i bought all my icp in the last week because it bottomed out and all the fud made it an obvious buy. i haven\\'t really even read the moonman stuff. seems like an actual based thread for once i don\\'t have a hardware wallet currently and none of my wallets support icp, what do? i don\\'t plan to sell probably until next run. supply is running out what happens if it hits zero? why haven\\'t they suspended withdrawals like they did when this happened with xmr? really? it\\'s the same principle. something similar i can think of is gym memberships. gyms rely on the fact that only a minuscule fraction of their members will show up at any one time. what would happen if everyone with a membership to a local planet fitness showed up at the same time? it\\'s common knowledge they do this with fractional reserve banking and paper silver, so why not cryptoassets? you sell icp you don\\'t have under the assumption that nobody will notice you don\\'t have it, only it\\'s harder with crypto because everyone can see what you\\'re doing, which is when this happens, and people start withdrawing. don\\'t care, i hold my icey piss on huobi if your icp is on a exchange you don\\'t have icp, rather only a claim to icp. https://vocaroo.com/fuivmvml binance probably has multiple wallets. cz, you chink motherfucker. yesterday\\'s dip was time to get ass at a discount now that the price has gone up again indeed ass bro retard this santa is rallying muh dick today i made money \\'cause i\\'m a cheap whore ok call me when tqqq drops % in a day and you have no assets to slurp the dip. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nog eybeobgm post your bags spy, tsla, and aapl look interesting. i margin\\'d into soxl at last week and flipped it but i wanna save that shit as a strategic reserve attack missle most of the time :p and then just swing soxl took a goddamn phd to figure out for sure \"ladies and gentlemen (heh) it is me, gregory mannarino.\" heh. it\\'s over. even if it does break you are getting reversed on. what is everyone\\'s favorite anime and what is your current favorite stock?

hay bud i have a question for you tonight, i am in an arguement with a mate right now about how best to clean up the \"berkeley pit\" in butte montana. i ve been going back and forth with a mine environmental engineer on this for the weekend, your thoughts? how would you clean that mess up? won\\'t deny that kek i wonder if the berkeley pit water processing could pay for its self in suspended heavy metal recovery. i know the water treatment plant at britannia beach near vancouver bc paid for its self in its first years from all the copper stripped out as filter cake from the mine water they treated. i think it\\'s ugly as shit but it gets the job done. we call it the \"layer cake.\" it doesn\\'t look good on a mine dump but would work fine in an open pit since it already has steps in it. i love these sorts of challenges, their huge and i will likely never actually have to deal with it myself, but their great to think about as an exercise. while i don\\'t agree with you at all, you dumb motherfucker will always make me laugh. love you. love you too \\'anon\\' serious question: why is baywhores such an overhyped miner on chan, from all miners? are there any rational reasons? i just want to make money in crypto, is that too much to ask lets escape to the moonscape i just want to land a crypto job, holy shit. what\\'s wrong with that? lots of skills but no demand since the bull run is over just lmao at you poorfags b-b-b-but bitcoins will make me richhhhhhhhhhh no fuck face it wont and you\\'re a dense nigger if you think it will. btc etfs and we cant even break k lmao just cope more newfag. checked hooooooooooooooooooly fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck wagmi it is written forever ooooooooooooooooo witnessed akhi if being late means i can still grab a x in the last three months, i guess we have different definitions of being too late to make it. you will never be a billionaire demoralization thread stopped in its tracks. we will be independent and free. nobody is buying your bags boomer , you shouldn’t have bought a literal ponzi scheme there are people here trying to \"make it\" with their $ \"portfolio\" okay buddy oh great strategy i dont see what can go wrong with htis shut up im gonna make it this will mint billionaires and millionaires, you need to know how big this is. everyone who gets in on day will be a millionaire in . twrxa the man\\'s a living legend. hating on richard heart is basically a mental disorder by now. green ids will make it. yellow/blue you will halfway make it. it doesnt matter. if you hate kikes you gonna make it regardless. rollins i will make it by buying liteinu, don\\'t need green id am i awaited?

comfy as hell i want more meme power from the corbros! corbros, i’m terrified by the idea that vlad’s carriage might depart before i finish packing my m bag. where do i stake large sums of usdc for minimal risk and high apy? crypto.com offers % apy and i haven\\'t seen much better than that. minimal risk of rug as well. are you retarded? this is a legitimate question blockbank accepts usdc, bnb,egld, btc and other coins and their apy is around %, i have been using their platform for a long time now i\\'ve tried both cro and blockbank buddy, but i must tell you blockbank is more preferable, apart from their strong security which is their priority, i also cherish their customer support which is very active as well as their ai robo advisor for an investment tips it’s over. welcome to the monero general, dedicated to the discussion of the world\\'s leading decentralized pp privacy cryptocurrency! android: monerujo https://pastebin.com/nkewtqaj reporting in itzyjs (why bitcoin might not be the safe investment you think it is! - bursting bubbles) [:] *****/xmr/ monero general info-dump***** - added a new section about traceability fud proof of stake isn\\'t a good thing for monero. no premine, no dev tax; founder fees. witnessed ufmwahlpiwmdoodswq no reply wirey boi!!!!!!! poompa . lost told you guys getting close now. sounds like you don\\'t care about privacy either. you know what to do. you should! maybe buy a dog meme instead, i hear they make excellent investments. we don\\'t need nfts, we have monerochan we are waiting for you to sell how does avax protect my privacy? nigger the tiny amount of wow i mined earlier in the year did not make a difference in xmr\\'s hash. the tiny amount of xmr i currently mine now makes little to no difference. i dca into xmr way more than i could ever mine. that\\'s what actually helps its price. wow is an experimental coin made by devs who fly by the seat of their pants. the people who go hard into it are the same people who buy other dog coins. nobody serious about xmr is going to buy enough to make a difference and getting mad at someone for that is just as much a waste of energy as getting mad at doge holders. take your meds. which one of you commissioned this and why has it never been shared here? captcha: asspy you can get xmr from fiat at kraken us, coinbase us, no. also vice versa. whatever you do avoid binance (non us) as it is greatly rumored that they are doing paper xmr, a.k.a. fractional reserve xmr. really said as one who buys from them pays liquidity pool fees to transact there, without there being an actual liquidity pool. a literal chang figuring out to jew you over twice. checked, and remember, to be truthful on your taxes goy. ir is the most successful revenue agency on the planet. with fractional reserve debt, every dollar they take in, more can be printed ;) i need xmr to go up might, yet our girl can be an angry little crab \\'lounging in a hammock\\' commission is finished. very happy with how this one came out. checked, like something else is going up now looks realistic that way here\\'s versions without the foreground for you anon. and the focus is the figure, but if you have other crap that is fighting for your attention it\\'s bad composition. fuck off pleb. can someone please make me a monero version of this pepe? or better yet, this one. i like the finger placement of the chainlink one rope soon i like it in burgerland, only kraken has it. xmr is the best swing trade coin. ez and safe % gains per trade feels fuckn good zec currently envisaging the miasma you mean the same market that says dog memes are valuable? just had the idea for a monero chan tron related commission or put another way: i don\\'t give a shit about short-term price action because once sanity finally returns to the market as it historically always has fundamentals will reign supreme. and you don\\'t get better fundamentals than being on the cocaine standard. growing real-world adoption sez \"no\" what are your thoughts on scrt? i\\'m not shilling and i only own xmr but i\\'m curious on your thoughts. apparently it\\'s less secure but has interoperability with apps on it\\'s blockchain. is it decentralised or pozzed? as usual nothing can compete with monero. synthetic xmr sounds interesting anon, i\\'ll take a gander. i was only looking at scrt for it\\'s price potential but it\\'s crazy to think monero only has a x on it\\'s mc. we\\'re truly undervalued imo g#moneroreplacingbitcoin i\\'ve done crypto-related threads on other boards and without prompting i\\'ve seen monero chads swarm in and start promoting it and discussing it with people, because monero people actually believe in their coin and tend to be really zealous and puritanical (in a good way) as they view % of other coins as compromised garbage that have nothing to do with why bitcoin was originally created in the first place. i sold at should i bite the bullet and buy back now? sup boiis my average entry price is $. average it out with some dca, i started buying in around $, and bought more when it was it\\'s not doing anything keep wondering why some fags still buying this shit when there are lots of solid defi gems in the block at cheap prices to be honest defi plays are where the money is located now recently made some good bucks off spool, got in during the fair launch. the two scenarios in which i see this being a problem are if you don\\'t have much time left on earth or if you took out short-term loans to buy. i vividly recall a lot of pink wojaks in after people took out high interest rate or otherwise short-term loans and were panic selling bitcoin at k after having bought the \"top\" at or k. long term hodl on the only coin in the space with fundamentals is a good strategy, i wouldn\\'t stress too much so long as you can pay your bills in the short term fren some of us just want to watch the establishment burn. some anons like to donate to causes as \"freedom of expression\". pic unrelated based ill give it a look see. thanks. _rwif we must put an end to this criminal coin. think of the children. no faggot. wallet nodes only get the blocks needed since the last time it was closed. another pro tip is to reset the wallet height to something like, now? maybe do it quarterly? how? send all of your monero back to your wallet. all of it. yes it is a loop. making a nice single tx out of all of the little turds. goes to the mempool, gets mined into a block, bam, new wallet height. fucking amazing huh? is there a monerochan facebook group? vodkas love xmr huh insult order, i think i sold xmr at and now i’m too butthurt to buy back in. should i just become a wownero whale now? wownero is purpose built shitcoin, no we clearly made a bottom on xmr/eth i feel. stupid from me to not have accumulated enough yet. tapping in &lt; also shoutout to dero https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/ne possibly the most bullish thing for xmr i cant wait to see what happens over the next few years there is no greater feeling than bwing a monero extremist let the soonposting begin hoard xmr anon hey chads, i lost k$ in leveraging and loan sharks are on our asses. now tell me which passive incomes are you in right now? i don\\'t want risky shits now. i just don\\'t understand the concepts behind nfts and metaverse, any explanations appreciated metaverse is where you get to rape women but there arent laws against it yet tl;dr: it\\'s all going to zero faggot. now go away. forgot to attach an anime girl because i\\'m retarded. time to log off. you guys are fucking retarded and i hope you die in a nursing home being abused by niggers on medicaid for trying to promote ponzi schemes post your fucking gains this week/day or month whichever looks best you coping faggots. no one wants to buy your trannycoin go back to fucking reddit and trade karma while you worry about paying rent you faggots redpill me on decentraland gayfts will probably reach its pinnacle next year, then get watered down and lose its market value by a lot and then slowly get stabilized. nfts are a cargo cult of actual blockchain tech. i am not moving out or spending a cent until i have at least $,, same. i live with my parents. they have no idea my net worth is much bigger than of all my family, they think i am dirty poor kek. i will move out once i have a few millions without telling anyone about money i find this so funny, racism is never going away no matter how much people scream about it. also , job, live at home, k crypto, life is good. wouldn\\'t have it any other way are you all larping? i\\'m exactly the same, eurobro living the neet dream. but sometimes it feels lonely, you know. i\\'m from spain and today was the christmas lotto day (something kinda big here). we were all watching tv and there was this family crying because they won k. they were about to have a panic attack because it was \"life changing money\". and all my family was emotional watching that scene. i don\\'t know if biz and crypto is making me delusional. i wish i had some crypto neet friends. it feels lonely. that\\'s what we\\'re here for fren. lived with parents till , just bought my house. need to start accumulating all over again, but without my parents i\\'d be on the street. a black bull is fucking your future vlonde trad qt right now while you stay inside never seeing her unimaginably based don\\'t listen to this /pol/tard. i moved back into my parents house at to go back to school. i\\'m now finishing med school. it all depends on how you use that cushy, sweet parental housing. based zoomer of discrimination don\\'t worry fren, we\\'re on our way. then you can finally live! year old here as well, k in crypto, k in the bank and k in csgo skins. i also hate niggers and when i travel outside of my city or country i only tip white uber drivers, and rate niggers star indians are repulsive, perverted and unhygienic, but they aren’t a net drain for society and they can’t be compared to niggers. i don’t have much experience with niggers myself because i live in a small european city so i only got to know one of them personally but the large majority of interactions have been negative. i hate them because their existence in the western world only brings negativity, race-mixing, lowering of the average iq, ignorance, laziness, rape, violence, stealing and all sorts of other crimes. that’s why personally i only hate niggers living in the west and respect those who remain where they belong i was going to suggest you to take a look on wallfair so you can get make some money but then i realized you are a parazite and don\\'t fucking deserve it! i want to move out but the housing market in my euro cuck country is so fucked that it would be financial suicide. it\\'s insane. i\\'m years old. don\\'t understand why people are having a hard time getting laid when living at home though. just bang them at their place or at the beach/outdoors. kek sorry op, a shame you shorted your lifesaving and are going to be living with the bums soon yeah, i hold crypto right now. should\\'ve listened to those who left at k. learned my lesson. just waiting for the bear/bottom. next run, i\\'ll make it. bro you\\'re comparing the market to when it had million people investing, to the over million people now involved. bitch ass monkey nigger k is literally fucking programmed in. the pixels prove it. should i lock my crv and earn interest or hold? what does this chart say to you? i farm on arbitrum.curve.fi when gas is cheap i sell crv and fxs for cvx and lock it. dont tell me you did not load up as much monero under dollar as you possibly could anon! mmmmmmmmmmmoneros how can i start my own shitcoin? you need a team of few people. dev, graphics, mods, marketing. i could do fx/graphics this is an idea that i had, a crypto to appeal to the mmo fandom. they generally are big spenders &amp; it hasn\\'t really been done before bobros something doesn\\'t feel right and there is literally no one who wants to buy them. who else is very busy today working from home? i have taken a huge shit and then jerked off everyone else took early leave for christmas and i\\'ve completed all my tasks, so i\\'ve basically got a free day off its kinda cold i sent one email, and i just finished reading berserk now checked. just going on playing vydia and wfh. newfag here. wanna start trading asap. could you guys gimme some advice please? (things to read, videos to watch, advice on which sites i should use to trade.) pretty please :d. literally three quarters of the posts on /biz/ are people trying make you poorer and getting paid to do it. keep that in mind and then follow naicu, preach to dem kids anon oh yes, finally guys, after a whole day dissecting this site, i finally found the password. dev gave me b tokens as a reward, you should keep an eye on the site, apparently more challenges are to come the image that got me $ dollars richer the flippening is around the corner, right guys? guys? what if you screenshot a bored ape and mint that as your own nft for ~$ and call it a pirated bored ape and just list it x cheaper than its nominal price? theres no copy right laws people do this on all marketplaces and other people fall for it. digital art is the stupidest use case for nfts i think we\\'ll have to use another name for all other nfts because normies think nft means digital art. nfts are links to art, not the art itself. coffeezilla. why did you stop taking zoloft this is what you fucking retards sound like. al/ecosystem/partners#partners oh no no no no the cope is unreal yeah its fast as fuck and dfk has sweet aprs on my jewel which just keeps going up? why the fuck didnt any anons shill jewel earlier. land plots going for sale in dfk as nfts will go bunta too like decentraland the hot girl with the nice ass in my building gave me little miniature apple pies she made and i was gonna heat one up before bed and forgot about it and left the over on broil when i went to bed. woke up at : to all my smoke alarms going haywire. took minutes to get them all off. why are women evil like this? violent % swings can someone with digit iq please explain whats happening? government injecting money big boys having fun. check the chart, year golden crab run. my guess is that big boys slowly distribute to newbies, before we enter a bear market and neets and unemployed covid stonkers will have to work again imagine the pain of being a passiv investor in the s thinking and then not seing profits for decades, even worse if you consider the inflation during that time this is why the america japan economic comparison holds no weight. japan is so fundamentally different about how they view the world and how to do business that comparing them to the us economy is pointless. america could stagnate for over a decade, but the policy makers there have shown time and time again that they will do everything in their power to never let something like that happen and the american people will gladly put themselves into massive debt for their next toy. what do you call this chart pattern? a- ca----- https://youtu.be/ggyepkysq yeah i\\'m an ass man ay caramba! you really think it’s going to bart? i thought it was just consolidation looks like an ass out to me love me some ass the fast and easy road to cents clement is next. do you? no this is dob nobody is buying and volume is collapsing i had the chance to get in early, but i didn\\'t do coins outside binance at that time. could ape in days ago tho, feeling pretty comfy. will sell some of it when(if) we breach ath and hold yhe rest until it either moons or goes to $ tell \\'em anon so is this a scam biz? i cannot expres how fucking bullish i am on this. buy and hold this and be rich, im out. shots fired. mm bagholders are hilarious. fucking kek really makes you think. the child has no debt . % of people doing the first. that\\'s why they will ngmi. just shut the fuck up all of you chainlink (ticker: link) is pumping, bitcoin (ticker: btc) dump is imminent i repeat: bitcoin dump is imminent i buy crypto based solely on the visual appearance of the logo and so far i am up about % since june. waiting for the public sale after the ido feels hydrated laurt is terras version of opensea and the ido in two weeks. gonna make it? pure name theft in it\\'s purest form. we are all gonna fucking make it. this is what i think about new projects. let\\'s say you got k and you want to spend it on cryptocurrencies. which coins would you choose? you can only pick a maximum of three coins. all in mist i dont give a fuck plant vs undead i bet he\\'s a pajeet kek xrp has been bouncing well in the past and, this isn\\'t the top for avax. just look at its chart. vxus i will definitely buy more egld, bnb &amp; eth then move straight to stake it in blockbank app for a decent passive earning how about adding mana, sand &amp; wfair to the list, this metaverse token are going to trend very soon especially wfair money skelly himself likes kleros. soon it will be a household name. kleros is truth. kleros is the ai. we are kleros. humans are the ai. but i am a gambling addict, so i love to stake or yield rewards in daos and other scams of that nature. avax and the shitcoins there are a fucking goldmine if you know what you\\'re doing captcha: yyyay make the switch and come over to avalanche network % avax comf welcome dobros. come to discuss our token which will no doubt eclipse b mcap in good time. we\\'re gaining hundreds of holders every day and our numbers are booming across every platform meanwhile tons of articles have been circulating about the successful space mission. never been comfier dobros heading to the moon now xgpky lu-xy nft marketplace will have a low fee and work on a scalable platform. third worlder here (pacific islander), i bought like half a billion of these, what am i in for in the next years? great riches. soon we will book the biggest fish. what we listening to today while we watch charts bnkbros fud from a defeatist person look at growth statistics guys it\\'s dead and looking like it will fix for another huge leg down. we can now admit the stunt failed. no one is even posting anymore on the thread like they used to. this shit is going to be a bagholder echo chamber soon. retard bag holder mostly the only one posting on this dead thread. learn to invest fag. reminder there\\'s a few anons here who usually snipe these for cents and then dump on em when they get too annoying, what do you think happened to all the other clones including the before this one out of my way no bonkers of negroid heritage billboards failed.... this might be it for db.... it\\'s over for db. too high marketcap, don\\'t miss out on liteinu anon, it\\'s already +% but it will moon violently. this. don’t miss this sh*t you fu*king pathetic biz lurker. if you want real cash, buy this coin. easy at the very least x. it is the next normie coin where we sell our bags on them. get in early. it’s under m marketcap right now. this is it. how are we feeling about this chart dobros? i feel like those are the catalysts for big exchange listings, showing that shib was willing to build an ecosystem for the future.. dev so daam big brain move but y no exchange?? idiot dev stupids they’ve started multiple polls to ask the community which mid tier exchange we should be listed on next, anon. hotbit is currently winning i think. that being said, kucoin has eyes on us as well. there will be dire consequences if you dare to moisten me up for nothing this pic fucking kills me lets gooooooooooo. get your buys in before monday lads, the exposure will poomp. another competitor bnked out of our way. will i make it? dgbnk rulez the best part of all this for me is when the express article called it dongbonk. honestly, i think it\\'s a better name. they fixed it now, but they still haven\\'t fixed eon musk. all savvy holders direct your attention here please / db lives rentfree in shibetoshi nakamotos head and your fud is not even stabding in his shadow. i\\'m very happy that db is really starting to take flight and leave biz. the twitter and subreddit communities are seeing exponential growth and constant engagement. it\\'s exactly what needs to happen. we\\'re at the cusp of a huge shift toward becoming mainstream. how do you expect to go parabolic while acting the same as the other meme coins? yeah, i’m thinking this is bullish i\\'m pretty sure at least half of the fud from this point on are db holders trying to accumulate. there\\'s no way anybody could be this retarded yeah i was wondering earlier if everyones just beating a dead horse but then i checked in on twitter and no no no, he was actually still seething even like an hour or two ago. ok ok ok i need the price to go up, every day i\\'m checking the price and it\\'s dipping oh god. every day i check the price it\\'s bad price. devs please fucking do something no refunds no refunds no refunds selling these in minutes. bye haven\\'t seen anything new lately, just the cheems shit that nobody cares about liteinu isn\\'t dead its up +% whom\\'st would win? what are other ways to make it if you missed out on the crypto? thanks i am completely demoralized. last week avax performance was amazing and this week looks like it\\'s going to be as good as last one, i\\'m as comfy as it gets. incessantly spammed by a few guys (more likely just one guy) from their telegram / discord channel who will pop into a thread (or make one) agree with each other about how great it is (always post by this id) and then vanish faggot enlighten me of your holdings, you undoubtedly go into avax late, i\\'ve been here since february welcome to the avax club where we all get to see the wall street giants go down spectacularly it\\'s not too late for anything, you can still buy avax. avax acts independently from btc good morning sers from jaipur we have many good deals to give today please sers only a few moments shill me a sub m marketcap coin with a solid use case that isn\\'t a shitcoin and that launched this year bond this is the one boys b.bank is one token you should look out to buy now before it starts it\\'s upward moves, it is the utility token of blockbank; a defi protocol that enables cefi &amp; defi operation in a single app also take into account kucoin\\'s performance since last year (has done a x which exactly matches the returns of bnb) but with an even smaller mcap and less name recognition. kucoin is growing fast, and there\\'s an opportunity to get into its lower cap ecosystem coins here. is it really this easy bros? why do countries with factories seem to thrive while countries without factories do not? is having a factory in your soil necessary for a good economy? they talk about all sorts of geopolitical topics such as the return to us isolationism, how russia is vulnerable as fuck considering they are ripe for invasion and have really no other option then to lashout and conquer some buffer states such as ukraine. china is fucked demographicall. and germany is destined for war apparently. those in to geopolitics often remark that you can predict a country its history by simply looking at its geographics. physicucks. keep playing around with atoms. what is this junk, and why is it pumping? another ghost chain?? how many fucking more ls do we need? america is back there is nothing to worry about sirs. the dollar is not worthless. the vaccine is magic. the price of icp will recover any day now. it\\'s true, but it\\'s \"lying with statistics\" because it doesn\\'t tell the full story holy shit lads. i agree even though i voted bernie based biden trump is the real racist antisemite biden is based af i want to rimjob jen psaki yeah great job amerikeks holy fuck, i’m unironically ridin’ with biden. i kneel. oh anon, you\\'re here. under the desk...now. uuuh orwell is an antisemite and that book is racist. stop referencing banned literature, citizen chud. sell money printing as economic growth and success! even this boards is dead. eth flips btc by summer (eth pump btc dump) bear market until , everyone owns nothing by because they got shrekt noooooooooooooooooo your bogger is showing out of your nostrils. it will be the biggest fucking thing of next year. you will regret not buying into any of these \\'\\'dumb\\'\\' projects. good luck missing out on profits anon. seriously what the fuck? interesting thesis i bought cardano (ticker ada) dip last week instead of fantom (ticker ftm) dip. every time. when will this fucking board learn? i hope you die poor what is wrong with this guy? ehehehe what layer is that he is midwit normie cuck who had great success with an overly simplistic website. that\\'s all! erm, helloo? are you sure about that?imagine if there was a network with btc interoperability that enabled these features for btc. oh him? he seems like a nice person. what\\'s with all this bullshit about \"web \" all of a sudden? kek absolute pottery hoo lee shit. dorsey didnt just leave, he fucking fled. nobody ever actually has ever gotten canceled he is scared because he knows whats coming yeah sure, the fact venture capitals bought at cents and are dumping non-stop surely doesn\\'t affect the price unironically kys altcoiners still seething i see needs a maga hat edit where hes happy i can\\'t tell if he is legitimately calling out the vcs for constantly pumping and dumping coins on web hype or if he\\'s just another dumb maxi who can\\'t imagine that there are going to be other applications for blockchain beyond a digital store of value. web coins have made a lot of anons very wealthy while at this point, bitcoin is only going to make people who bought in early or are already rich wealthy. i win for ignoring all this. it\\'s a distraction from the fact ls are gathering liquidity for web fast. look at crv just as one example. web is a meme to people who don\\'t understand the osi model. see you late fags on the otherside. wat all of the good opportunities in this cycle have passed. there are no more , , or x coins left now. it\\'s fucking over and you know it. every coin in the top is sitting at a billion right now. wake up. all opportunities? i agree the risk reward isn\\'t worth it anymore. undoubtedly there will be something that a link in the bear market but most investors are going to slowly bleed money. that ido was something else desu scam or not?

is it more likely to go down from here, or up? pic related. it seems to be the main selling point of qredo, but doesn\\'t ccip solve this (and without a kyc wallet)? i\\'ve asked it before and i\\'ll ask it again inb: a jeep gladiator, one of the most common cars on the road i will go to salt baes restaurant, order the most expensive courses then washed down with the most expensive champagne. all served by the man himself. shit ton of maid outfits and boots moonman said he never specified a date for his predictions. well turns out he said bitcoin would hit $k by november and $k by eoy https://archive.wakarimasen.moe/biz hope this guy kills himself. cant even sustain a pump over . pathetic. all you bagholders will shibaghold your shibags to zero. especially you bruno. shi(b)toshi bagholdmoto wagmi shibbros! you should be shibarrassed strong magic. you\\'ve already lost fudshill. what is the point of having thousands of different cryptos if they all just follow bitcoin? someone explain this to me. fantom is interoperably better than ethereum $ eoy it really is. two things we all have in common: we\\'re all love men and we all love fantom!!!! copy pasta bro kekd incoming fvm. as a trick for high performance demos, dags are great. i can make a blockchain+dag that demos m tps with little effort. the problem is that dag speedups are bounded by causality, so in the demo everything is unrelated to it can all run in parallel but in the real world you have the \"small world\" problem and ahmdel\\'s law that cap a dag\\'s max performance boost at x-x the speed of if you were just running a sequential strategy. if you\\'re wondering why sol is so congested, even though they said/demo-ed much higher numbers, this is why. in practice, i don\\'t expect a \"dag chain\" to exceed ~k tps on real world workloads. you did it... you actually did it... anyone know about this app/token on soul? apy is fucking insane. how likely is a rug? fantom is going to top and there\\'s nothing you can do about it. how does x sound? ftm is a scam. figure it out, anons. tomb/ftm farm is comfy until we reach ath again, dips just buy you more time. days of tomb farming is equal to year of ftm staking. el oh fucking l %. wagmi fantom. feels good fantom bros also fuck the harry chink why is fantom always poompa against the market? based ftm chads fantom is going to top and there\\'s nothing you can do about it. metaverse coins are the new dog coins aren\\'t they ahem... maidverse. nope. but what is the next coin you can make it off, is femboybsc. k mcap, have you ever been this early? it is. not much to it at the moment, got a ways to go before the game is ready looks pretty good so far. is it an nft game? this is the sad reality of most programmers yeah, the idea is that special character nfts (maids) will have powers in the game. but it\\'s not really clear yet what the game will be like. it seems like gameplay will be inspired by a mobile game called maidmaster. still waiting to see how they plan to port it onto the blockchain cuteish asf, what\\'s the name of that game? i think in the game lore they\\'re supposed to be robots or cyborgs or something, they save humanity from killer machines everyone fomo into sand let\\'s goooo a smart contract that has machine learning functionality could completely replace some mid level wagie working in supply chain. any job that involves some guy taking in data, finding patterns, and preparing a report for a superior can be replaced by these things. and there’s an incentive to do so beyond just replacing his salary as companies could monetize the data. yeah but then how would a half of the world make a living if we replace them all with fucking machines? it has to happen eventually, those who know how to work in a computed environment will thrive and those who don\\'t will die, humanity does not need them anymore. ethereum is a sheep in a wolf skin. fantom is coming with fantom naming service expect to see tons of people on twitter using it in - weeks is this true? how can i profit from this? never bet against femdom. hence, ftm is a tranny coin. we\\'re all gonna make it so hard there is no site for ftm domain names right? no one here needs a degree: looks like ghostbro still has data leaks. undercover reporters have determined ghostbro has exited his own position. what does this mean for the baggies? its ooooooooovvvvvvvveeeerrrrrrrrr hahahahhhh dboniggers are fucking finisuer hajajahahahah autistic stunt failed devs drama no billboard niggers hahahahahavavavhahahahhahahhaa here they come top right corner of bubble on the last message, poorly photoshopped. this shit is dead are we getting kicked off of binance at the end of the month?

might as well by the brits if they\\'re the same price. all of my brits i purchased for the same price as generics at the time i bought it, but that has only happened times and i got bars each time over the past years or so if a mercury dime can win you a back-alley howdy-do, then what could a gold st. nick buy?

icp has to go x just to reach golds market cap. keep in mind that gold is just a useless yellow metal only used in jewelry and some industrial uses. silver is far more valuable. and buying icp at these prices is simply going to mint millionaires. those few who have the foresight to hold for the long term. it\\'s fucking over guys. he charted a perfect case for why it will launch if it behaves the same as last time is this guy scizophrenic forgot picrel definitely! that\\'s what financial analyst said before and said btc is just a bubble and that was during when it was at $k lol but they are on eth man fucking sucks. lol gas fees are shit man that\\'s cool what else they got?
