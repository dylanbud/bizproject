at least i can recognize it. there is no trial. the justice system only applies to niggers and nw less than $m but with blacks they will bend also i fucking hate women as much as the next guy, but

the second bear market? pain avoid tiny man. its always pajeets running each other for dollar profits i wanna back the truck with a few thousand algoys. if you can handle the pain. it\\'s not for everyone. i follow the twitter to keep my resolve during these unprecedented times yieldly is splitting their token for iyldy. slippery slope imo. they are going to keep taking future utility away from ydly captcha: vggy boys we are having a modest pump away from king shitcoin. what are peoples thoughts on birdbot? is this going to be another planets esque investment? of course. quick, make a wish before ze doomp! i\\'m still holding the belief that gems are being manipulated and something big is going to happen when the time is right hahahahahahahahahaha ohhh linkies i sold some algo while it was pumping because bitcoin was dumping. why doesn\\'t it stop pumping. blapu is making a comeback, liquidity increasing, dev applied to verify and it seems they finally hired someone to make a logo. not to mention its everywhere on algogems atm. https://youtu.be/oobuomtos this, it\\'s so new there are very few who know how to code in it. you\\'re probably better off learning it yourself and then hiring a team. tbots dev is not really an option since he has his own project and is dedicated mostly to his phd if he is to be believed. paradigm shift! are we going to see dollars again or is everyone going to redeem their governance and dump the market? they keep following &amp; get followed back by all the big algo nft names. tin hat but i think the wait will be over soon gemsbros i need my cheap algos i feel sick, very sick. im starting to see every fucking normie in my life get into crypto. was never like this before, even years ago. now every faggot thinks they can buy epicredditdogocoinifuckedmymother and become am millionaire. is crypto about to have a dot com bubble moment? i mean, there\\'s no way they\\'ll allow normies to make it, right? i already cashed out when i saw these sell signals so fuck it, kill them all with this castrophic crash. lads, he sold. waagmi i’m a full time landlord who day trades for fun, no i wouldn’t touch crypto with a ft pole (total ponzi scheme).... i had some stupid bitch (who i suspect is a plebbitor) back in september telling me how i needed to go all in on shiba and how she would be purchasing one of my unit apartment complexes after shiba mooned.... that was the most bearish sell signal i could ever imagine some bitch who drops by my office to pay her rent telling me she would be purchasing the complex she lives off her crypto gains entering? this was the top and i cannot believe i didn’t sell right then and there. after all these idiots like your bitch tenant have bought shitcoin, who\\'s left to prop the ponzi? the bull run can’t be over, right? this is retarded the bull run is over, khhv neets blew the entire $ grandma gave them for xmas on bitcoin, now it\\'s a long ride down to k. there will be full layer one evm and ethereum smart contract support in the first phase. the nevm reach up to million tps, beats bsc. basically combines best of eth with best of btc without the insane fees. actually useful and not the latest shitcoin you guys seeing the trainwreck that is the shib ama right now? at least its bringing out the beggars sirs i have not received the profit they mad thank you kumar, very cool! you will be happy i think this is a serious issue most people should be aware of when buying pos coins. here\\'s where i run out of information: which networks are vulnerable to this, in that they don\\'t limit validator stake, and that stake is proportional to block producing probability? i\\'d like to gather a list and make some sort of recurring thread to help myself and others stay away from vulnerable chains. i\\'m thinking to call it \"short attack general\", but am open to better names. bumping with booba pls answer i sold it all i either made the best or worst decision of my life. i am never buying a coin mentioned on /biz/ again bitcoin wait did they actually claim that? oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo same. for me it\\'s the icp acoooomulators like in the end, it was fucking icp holders posting their \"we\\'re probably going lower\" that got me. pump it now that i\\'m out, or keep dumping, i don\\'t care. my avax, rune, eth, egld, and luna bags are all comfy, but this hold has been busting my balls for months and i\\'m not doing this anymore. lmao unless you bought those for peanuts then i dont know what to say to you, probably low iq. i\\'m not saying go all in, but im saying you should be funneling shitcoins into icp as you make money off garbage. a- a-anon i thought u knew that its only gonne get lower? thanks for playing \"investors\" hahahhhhhaa i know bro just look at this chart scam confirmed based ignore the seething baggies, now they need another idiot to get them where they were kek he\\'s bussy recording, i mean writing his next crypto munmail, i hear he was bullish on flux and lu-xy ever since dominic went cold on him support at . seems to be holding next stop: federal fuck-me-in-the-ass prison i just watched meet the kevin interview with richard heart, why is he so annoying? using not-so-clever semantics (\"sacrifice\" lol) in an attempt to fool the sec only makes it a worse crime noooo daddy sec come get richard and pwut him in jayooo. i don\\'t like him and i don\\'t have any money because i didn\\'t invest in hex. get a grip you little pussy. you know nothing about securities laws. have fun staying poor go back shilling dog clones here or on plebbit, maybe that´s the only thing you can get done right. oh shit, the boys with the blue id´s are on the lookout for scams. hexicans, it´s over! at this point i somehow have to admit that i miss the days with frequent shitposting namefags. i checked the other threads and there was currently no entertainment in them or they were rugs where i would never buy a bag again. pic unrelated would passing the ct line be valid breakout? that´s just wrong. all of it! first of all the biggest part of the current uptrend is the incoming pulsex sacrifice, which also profits hex price. second fact is that i have not one but to dads. nigger caught red handed with ebonics. nice try jamal, stop projecting and no your dad is never coming back from that \"quick run to grab dem smokes yo\". not in an active way as far as i know. you passively pump the price of hex which is good for bagholders and maybe also yourself, if you keep some. make fucking sure you sacrifice from your own wallet, not from an exchange, if you want to sac at all. lets marky mark this shit biz bros also where are you other hex niggas? i prefer shitposting instead of spoonfeeding. oh fuck, it´s go time! freemasons assemble, the sac phase has been kicked off. i only bought this coin because i knew there was going to be an unlimited amount of retards on this earth who would buy the coin and stake it for years i´m so fucking hyped. this will become history. i bet k usd that carlos matos is having a ghost boner right now without knowing what´s going on. word plsx sac is live hex mooning. feels good there´s more going on. you may be really dumb but you ´re lucky enough to come to the right place at the right time. you have no idea how lucky you are. are you going to listen to weak fud like a retard or to the smartest man in the game rh? tick..tock goy you had years my year old dad put k into this shit now going onto pulsex he trying to get me into it but getting real bad fucking vibes from richard heart. i hope to god he doesn\\'t get rugged ill personally hunt down and kill that fucking cunt in minecraft stop being poor. oooo cent hex now, i bet jannies have stakes sac\\'ing hex is a really stupid idea if you own tshares, you idiots are not burning tokens you are giving them away to be sold for an airdrop. just buy eth and let that get dumped on that\\'s . million sacrificed in one swing it\\'s over for the bulls. nexo offers the best apy! change my mind. this is a paid shill thread dont fall for it i get it, i\\'m missing gains being a poor fag. shitcoins outperform but i don\\'t care. i\\'m not smart enough to time the market or know what\\'s going to moon at launch but i am smart enough to dyor and all three of these are genuinely useful. i see them as the google apple amazon of the crypto bubble. the ones that actually make it long term once regulations hit. when you invest right charts are just numbers and a light show. fuck your avatars long live the baker ken griffin, you have yil thread theme: tomorrow at am moass starts. wagmi frens. while shills infest here and give themselves a heart attack, my mommy just brought me some hot choccy in bed. i literally couldn\\'t be more comfy. hooly shiiit yeeeeeeees!!!! bring out your slurpers fellow apes, we are going to be billionaires! friendly reminder that it literally doesn\\'t matter if you have x shares or xxxxx shares, if you sell at or if you sell at ,,,. the squeeze is going to hit and reddit has decided to hold for an infinity pool and see just how high the numbers can go. whether you participate with any of your shares or not, this is happening when we squeeze, and no amount of bitching and moaning in these threads will do literally a single thing about it, except to make sure that the bitchers and the moaners are the only people guaranteed to miss out on the top. am still comfy! kenny is running out of mayo to use as lube. i have never seen so much fud before. so many people “concerned for my finances” and “doing it for fun” you are aware there is an anon here who has pretty often said that he’ll sell, right? all that needs to happen is hours without a fudpost wagmi frens! no fucking way lmao, i\\'m taking this why are you responding to them as if they aren\\'t a shill or a troll? ignore them and get comfy, fren luggy sebens! :dd:dddd:dd i declare that everyone in this thread is a faggot and it is imperative you all take your meds negative yes anon, please see picrel for supporting sources holding gme is like holding bitcoin back when it was $ for one. i don’t care about adoption or real world use. i don’t know who satoshi is and i don’t care. all i know is that wall st and banks are scared and they don’t want me to have it. they turn off the buy button. they take out ads to say they covered. they go on cnbc and say it’s overvalued. they say to sell and buy amc. they pay indians to infest these boards to spread lies and fear. happy new year and wagmi. for some there truly is no exit soon more weeks! i know the feeling. i remember someone told me to buy bitcoin at $. i waited and bought at $. glad i waited, why would i want something worth $ when i could have it worth $? patience is key here folks. holy mother of schizo wagmi, friends! yeah, i\\'m thinking based lucky \\'s! get better voices so kek you are still trying this? still waiting. bros...... what did they mean by this? i\\'ve seen this a million times and i still try to open it to this day he turned himself into an nft, funniest shit i\\'ve ever seen finally, i shall make some money with gamestop after a year selling my oh melvin nft\\'s. this was your plot all along wasn\\'t it cohen? i imagine his interns made him aware of this shit pile of a site with this designated shitting street of a thread stay comfy, comfy /gme/. aw. im watching the fucking old power rangers movie and you can\\'t do shit about it. i thought they epstiened you man ah, now it all makes sense play the game afterwards. if the marketplace does not cause moon then i do not care i was out all day, sneedfucks tell me why i should sell? stickyniggers what happened today? the jannies never learn. i mean everytime they look in a mirror they are lying to themselves. i think the new term is going to be maxwellsteined in the next few days kek when you heard it in an everyday setting it really does sound like multi level marketing, hope it works out for him anons i need to start nofapping so bad im staring to get bored of the already sickening things i fap to help try to make it a new years resolution. god knows i could use a break from excessive meat beating. im gonna have to try i went days without fapping since i was visiting family for christmas i was shocked by the amount i coomed when i got home. i forgot what a decen load is like checked. sometimes you need a week of recharging to replenish the supply and recalibrate the system. doomp inbound as kek demands nofap will be my new years resoluction yep, it sucks because companies don\\'t even want to hire new people. instead of wasting money hiring and training someone new, they would much rather give more work to existing employees or outsource it to pajeets. if they do hire someone, it\\'s because of networking. hell people are putting off retirement and hoarding jobs for much longer than they need to. system is fucked. tell me about a time when you were faced with a nonfren and you overcame it, i\\'m not saying there are wrong answers, just some better than others, also there are wrong answers lucky dubs who are you? it\\'s probably stupid, worried, angry, bit sad, all the shit you thought you had, listen, tight, the upside you missed, sunkissed, i snuck that bag checked by god, i have the destiny of the moass in the palm of my hand also cops are based d season\\'s greetings frens. i return to comfort you with alternative listening by way of radio dramas both old and new. christmas is past and the new year is coming. just going to keep the fort up for the rest of the year before starting things fresh. enjoy and i wish you a comfy new year. im high you\\'re hired. bought my gamestop, nfthink here u go i\\'d fuck a clone of myself. i just be seeing like mad fucking questions above my head and shit no top zuz take the egg talked to the walls, learned armageddon, earthworm james, sent with all blessing imagine getting dunked on by me and my frens, that\\'s embarrassing i got dubs but came is still better because baliteration weeks mmmm million kids each year checked. that’s got to be the worst part of it for them, knowing they lost to the people they barely even consider human sixth sense, so it\\'s nil, meet saint succotash, hank, pro-god, for the grill, the frank, suffer last, black coat, whip, trench knife, for the clever kid, rambo, sent by blight, what you never met, despite smoke, ya\\'ll\\'d choke on my next of kin keep trying kennies if my dick gets any better, there\\'s a problem, let\\'s put it all that way going to unironically find a woman who looks just like this (with wider hips) and sire a son army to protect my compound they just couldn\\'t help talk about the evergrande rally jesus christ ken get it together i ain’t gonna be a divvy begging bitch i just wanna see the classic gamestop company and store be successful the absolute hubris of these scum journalists. yo wu tang is actually lmfao imma smoke a blunt and eat some chickin i\\'m a fucking wigger but imma be worth a billie what do you mean by this fren? why haven\\'t you taken the stinkypill yet, anon? sometimes i dont wash my balls for a few days and sniff the smell for a dopamine hit. sometimes it smells like weed. any frens know why? ok thank you it\\'s never going to even go above $ again reminder that these are the people you are holding the stock with. g o o d n i g h t you get what you fucking deserve bring him back i didn\\'t make the call yet i\\'m a bit of a november guy myself bless. behold it\\'s frickin gamestop. nfts will work well with ownership and trading of games. i was reading other things about content being encrypted or some bulshit. people have to be very creative with these things. maybe they wont be the only viable marketplace, but things look good with the low gas fees and the with the gamestop name, a user can expect a good experience and not be scammed. held this shit for over a year. fucken hell not long til xmas next year. heard ryan cohen is crafting some sweet twitter shit posts for the coming months of crabbing and general fuckery. they\\'ll probably be nft\\'d at some point. i want this one are you brave enough to go, tell me so~ and write our name in fire on each other\\'s heart how would i go about finding out if one market (asia, europe, usa) is responsible for consistently dumping minute over minute, or day after day? i have a hunch the asian markets are responsible for a lot of the recent bitcoin and crypto related dumps. is there an economic boom occurring in the south? what is the cause of this migration? the governments there just don\\'t harass you in every minute of your life just for fun. america will be split into a socialist north and a capitalist south just like korea and vietnam https://youtu.be/n-jdddunyy / of license plates in houston are california i agree personally, which is why i\\'m sticking it out in yankeeland. besides, this is where my roots are. maybe this is just coping, but living in an economically stagnant area does have some upsides. big part of them but other southern states are also high on the list last thing we need is more awfls and niggers shitting up the place. jfc can we just have one fucking thing? i hate liberals so much it is unreal the refugees are also going to places like nevada and arizona as well. is it weird to normies that i do this? i don’t think i’m doing anything wrong i\\'m a yo going on and i have fucking no idea what is zoomer or women text etiquette, i just fucking reply when i can, and sometimes its instant. some females ghost me if i text them back within a minute, some females ghost me if i text them back an hour later. how the fuck can you judge someone on a fucking time to text? or even \"double texting\" shit is fucking retarded, starting to not even bother texting now, i only reply to my parents or older boss, and they dont give a fuck cause they are boomers don\\'t you have some kind of chat platform like slack or something? jfc imagine even calling or texting a coworker. if it\\'s a quick question it\\'s chat and if it\\'s something important it\\'s email. what retarded kind of industry are you in? anon, i… i dont text or call anyone other than my mother the word chad is meaningless now. i\\'ve seen simps refer to themselves as \\'chads\\' for donating + dollars to their favorite titty streamer. disgusting loser creaturas think they\\'re \\'chads\\' for dabbing on \\'incels\\' who criticize women for being gross whores with faces slowly melting from overusage of makeup. everything in (and soon, ) is just a giant cope by losers. you don\\'t respond instantly because it shows you\\'re not doing anything more important, like working, concentrated studying, or in-the-moment activities that are more interesting than whatever notification just pinged on your phone. then why would they waste their time texting me. meds go on you medical history, which means good luck ever getting a job in any government agency. well, i may be married, but we still fuck probably times a week on average. i don\\'t like when i have to type stuff and wait for it, and i don\\'t want anyone else to as well. fuck niggers, fuck trannies, and fuck jannies why do wagies gossip like high schooler? because they\\'re loserds i gave my two weeks notice to in my last job out of some respect because they treated me fairly then other places. my boss said they wont mention a thing and i did this when nobody was around after hours except for my boss, but days later it seems the news has spread around the office. i don\\'t know if wagies just sense it, or my boss spilled the beans, but ti lost all respect and just didn\\'t show up the following week, they called and i just lied and said \"sorry my new job wanted me in early for training\" and they still let me off on \\'good terms\\' and actually still paid me for my final week no amount of gains will bring her back. no one else would ever contact me on fb messenger. please give me the strength to ignore it bros you\\'ll read that message. back? either fuck da pussay or not why are u redditors so into these romance larps? on it. genuinely pisses me off who? thank goodness i loved her bros... i will never

awesome. decent size too for being fractional although the bird on the back looks derpy as shit compared to the other austrian coins ohh and fuck china. china is asshoe and their coins are way overpriced get triigered china hatin bitch my next coin will probably be either a manx cat or another st. gaudens, graded this time. i might be trying to sell most of my random silver and buy another engie finally gonna organize my stuff. when i get my wojak and fox coin? impossible to get accurate statistics on how many are actually out there. the closest thing you can get to is the pcgs and ngc population reports, and that\\'s for graded examples. you also have to take the pittman act into consideration so original mintage numbers don\\'t tell the full truth as to what is rare and what is not. that\\'s the reason why regular morgans are the most common and the peace dollar goes for hundreds in circulated condition. all it takes is a massive credit freeze in our financial system and people start panicking about where they\\'re going to park their money the next time it happens. it\\'s the reason why the elite and buying all the physical assets that they possibly can, and if the same concept could apply to numismatics, we can see the bar of graded morgans lower drastically causing higher leverage for lower ms graded coins. caved and bought my first gold coin. also got some

i\\'m always harping on the telegram that we\\'re not on exchanges yet. whatever you throw in right now absolutely will turn into a fuck ton lr that logic could be applied to any of those coins. might as well buy all the trending coins. the reason this doesn\\'t work is because trending has always been a sell signal. the majority must be wrong. if everyone thinks it\\'s going up then the price already reflects that, everyone has already put money they\\'re willing to bet. if everyone thinks the price is going down then the price already reflects that as everyone has already sold. youre supposed to buy when sentiments are bad, ie it\\'s not trending. this token hasn\\'t finished dumping yet. im doubtful it\\'ll get on an exchange without decent forewarning as these developers always rumor out the incoming news. what is museo? atus/?s= this is a paid shill thread what marketing company send you? picked me up a bag last week. lets goooooo! the museo ceo was caught raping his little

wasn\\'t the only swingie it seems we’ve been in a rising linear channel for months, don’t swing! sold k rose to try and swing it for the first time and of course it pumps to shit. at least i was smart enough to leave k staked i got myself buttfuckes by life and now i need to sell my stack bros. ffs i promise to buy x more after this shitstorm i will stop burning money with mtx and will stack as much roses as i can. my rosies stay cozy brose macallan , do you have it? yes, two glasses, actually, no, make it three. my friend here bought avax and is having a tough time. also more details are coming on the meta/rose partnership in q isn\\'t it a bit weird that bitcoin is doing the dumping and we are pretty comfortably hodling the line? *ahem* thank you forgot meme lines never seen a coin give less of a fuck during a big btc dump, makes sense too seeing as i have a k rose rebuy at . that i swung a few days ago and got meme\\'d on that\\'s never getting filled. i\\'d definitely rope if i didn\\'t have k still staked. please make it stop poomping, i just want to buy i also follow this, it sucks but it does almost always go back own. i have k rose, it\\'s my biggest stack. is this enough along with avax and eth? i sold about eth for rose a while ago and what i got for it is worth . eth now. all in rose or rope. forgot i actually sold some rose for some other stuff + k missing that i swung, so it would be more than . if i still had it all. all in on rose baby, have just over k rose that i was lucky enough to get at at average of c the only question now is whether we\\'re going to pull a fantom or going to pull a solana i set a bunch of buy orders before sleep at pretty high prices so i didnt make them very big and i wake up to a solid - crab with only buyes filled climbing up until i reach k rosies, currently have k staked on binance. i can feel the pressure of being a poorfag. seems artificial, maybe the lord just doesn\\'t want to let me buy any do i pick one of these guys after loading my wallet from kucoin and stake away? dumb question but am i sending the coins to that wallet and hope they\\'re safu or does my wallet get added to the the staking list and i can yank my roses out at any time? if it\\'s all the same i\\'d probably go for stakefish since it\\'s only a % pool feel it just keeps going up go down. pic related even the captcha says gg lengthening cycles will play out. we will reach k btc in . rose will probably reach $. just dca. i am putting all my money into eth at this point and transferring it to rose whenever there\\'s a dip. so comf this happens all the time. just give it a few hours or a day. they are sketchy-reliable we are hollow men, subsisting in a hollowed-out society. each year, our rights retreat, our purchasing

that is going to be explosive for crypto, right? it could start as early as january but certainly by july you will feel euphoria again. you can try to swing but don\\'t fuck yourself. aaaaaaaa i just

is literally going to without money from the chinese. it says right there tell that shit to the tourists. plain and simple. these past two years have been a blessing in disguise. first, a chink virus forces the u.s. to print more money but nobody gets mad because muh comfy coofs! crypto has singlehandedly brought china to its knees because they\\'re huge-risk gamblers who have decimated every one of their own stocks already and have put themselves in a debt hole that they can\\'t get out of now. the u.s. can\\'t bail them out because we\\'re too busy printing money for ourselves. china is so broke now they can\\'t even buy any our overinflated debt lmao. china will literally become another nothingburger country like india. the best thing they can do after that is learn how to function as a democratic society like those russian retards who are terrible at it since the \\'s. the u.s. has the best military on this planet. all russia and china can do is saber rattle countries like georgia, ukraine, taiwan, singapore, etc. if they even try some shit, we will end their shit quick going to put a grand or two on this who here ready to crab to $,/coin is /biz/ just a marketplace for

digital asset-backed lending we\\'re going back to $ btc and $ ethereum ain\\'t we? no. crabbing through as hype gradually winds down, then a hard dump to base mining cost, then another bull run after the next halving aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh no. the bottom as of now will be arround k. i doubt we will ever go as low as you say. yes. ain\\'t it comfy watching chinks bankrupt themselves down to a nd world country? this is not about bullish/bearish, but there will be a dump tomorrow, will it rebound? idk fuck chinks. i hope they are forever excluded from crypto. the de-chinking of btc will be a new golden era. bump for glorious china fpbp i\\'ve been looking over this board recently and don\\'t get why you guys hate us over at /r/antiwork? we both have the same common goal, to never work another

saving since my childhood in the s. i could\\'ve sold them for maybe $,-, this year, so it wasn\\'t the end of the world when it went missing from my parents house. now my dad feels bad about it, and gave me a dozen or so booster packs and a few decks, all from modern sets printed this year. i have a hard time imagining the sealed boosters from being worth much another years from now. what\\'s the best move for selling sealed decks and boosters packs? if your old cards weren\\'t in near mint condition were worthless. invest in lillie, tho. i have a lot in vvs right now. i\\'ll be okay, right? one day, you will die. i\\'m going to front run you faggots so hard. they all just got listed on ebay. enjoy getting pennies on the dollar for yours. green island in the sea of red. how are we feeling steakfans hey if any of you didn\\'t see it yet another dex opened and currently is at around m mcap. https://aurorashiba.com/ what are the financial ramifications of this? cro day of posting this until they mail my jade card any nigger that refuses to get an avax, maxi or joe bag will end up serving me some mcshit rana edition i\\'m still shocked that they got normies into crypto. i remember watching youtube videos about the concept in and barely understanding it. back in the day you had to go to some stechy mcdonald\\'s and trade cash for crypto. never thought normies would care for some wow gold. ntain.html is buying comex slices the most based thing we can do? https://youtu.be/dfevewvjuq goes deep and is a much watch. sharing my dd again. did it in an earlier thread but if anybody missed it here it is ential--bagger andy you need to clear your browsing history before doing these videos. or at least delete the porn sites wow the boards moving fast tonight, have a bump! talk to you all later! post any companies you want looked at tonight or tomorrow, got stuff to do right now. so how long am i stuck bagholding gayhorse and jew lagoon for? very small explorer in north brazil. i kind of like their d models, their geology seems super-simple. can the different deposits all be connected? bummp if you only knew how much hype thorstarter is going to generate in january. i just want this fucking year to end, even though the next one is probably gonna be just as shitty if not worse thanks to the current state of this fucking market same here someone\\'s mad here i have a feeling a massive btc dump will come soon we almost always dump during hours where not much liquididy is available. my guess is that it is accumulation (but only for a relief rally to -k) or preparations for a flash crash below k. guess we will know it very soon i think so too anon. but i\\'ve already tethered everything except for btc so i\\'m feeling pretty comfy right now. he means the alts that will survive through a bear market and then pump afterwards, newfag. interdasting wagmi the best thing about the impending bitcoin crash is the worst affected will be the most stubborn, arrogant bitcoin maxis. smart money and weak hands are out already and will profit. ascending triangle forming on the minute. get fucked bobo charles schwab or sofi markets are sussin\\'. fear does that why does crypto innovate so much more rapidly than other industries? lack of regulations and an emphasis on open source code/foss. regulatory capitalism/closed source leads to pic related. i\\'m still not buying. k or no deal. hmmm, best i can do is k. digital tokens don\\'t really interest me ill start dcaing at k very convincing thesis. i revise my target and i too will not buy any over k adamus-predictions-/ how are we feeling? i still think this coin has potential despite the sideways movement. if you think this coin has a future, post in this bread the shit they did to the site was pretty based, but the price is stagnant. though i guess that\\'s not the worst thing rn seeing as how everything is fucking dying the btc chart is drawing a \"l\" just like the losers you are. flokieve not too late brobinos will btc be bussin bussin or sussin sussin in fr fr that pepes deadass buss bussin it seems that most people aren\\'t actually anti work but just want more bucks an hour. a few fringe morons want a \"world without work\" but largely its just fast food wagies realizing how poor they are. first of all, i hate fast food. second of all, how do i profit? i browsed the shithole a few times , had some chuckles got bored after a while. i think its funny that they think they aren\\'t replaceable and that they think they are actually hurting the corporations pockets. this is the biggest burger cope i ever witnessed lu-xy is the next big thing in crypto and is becoming the go to place for the best nft lu-xy_io is making the best nft platform available for everyone lu-xy_io is built to be multichain, starting with the polygon blockchain allowing it to be fast, scalable, green, low cost, and user-friendly. are you actually a retard? lu-xy_io is designed to offer a new and much improved nft market place experience. that sounds fine to me we work towards freedom, they just bitch about it. it worked didn\\'t it? how\\'s sitting at home complaining about rich people working for you? i studied investments and made the right calls. not the same as flashing your tits. either way, i never have to work again. isn\\'t that the point of your commie circlejerk? who\\'s really the idiot here? imagine actually thinking - is a normal work day. so glad i\\'m in a job where i can leave at pm and have the rest of the day for me and my family you know thots say they\\'re just meeting market demands, right? throwing out econ terms does not make you smart lmao shut the fuck up and get me my tendies and fries wagie scum, or i\\'ll send a complaint email to hr and have you fired. so poor kek. chad employer poorfag btfo, back to work wagie. nooooooo!!!!!!!!! workers can\\'t demand things from their employers, it can only be the other way around!!!!!!!!!!!! nooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!! fixed it btw, these people are seething nocoiners. ahem, this is /biz/, we have always been a pro-work board as this is for business and finance. he\\'s right. they\\'ll never stop. if you aren\\'t happy with your wage, get a better job. most wagies deserve a $ an hour pay cut for the shit job they do. i am. i want to tip my boss more,and fund my extra education/training. not projecting, i\\'ve been a boss before and none of you wagies even deserve a lunch break. isn\\'t it time for bed wagie? work tomorrow and you need to be fresh and ready for your boss. the cold war ended in why are you obsessed with communism given that most people who shout that word don\\'t even know what it means? you come off like someone who repeats what they hear off their dad\\'s cable news broadcasts lol lmao historically retarded. revolution when? gets co-opted by glowies who distract the retarded commies from the real (((problem))) and gets them yelling at white people and simping for minorities and women? what a delicious bait alright back to work now wagies. my chicken tender plate isn\\'t going to materialize itself most of them are actually just retarded from all the corn syrup and chemicals in the water. this time last year i had exactly zero dollars and had to go to my parents\\' house every day for dinner. the money i invested didn\\'t grow on trees and i got where i am without a job. they could be free from work if they had a brain, they just can\\'t / won\\'t accept they\\'re the unwashed masses and don\\'t have the iq to make it. i\\'m well aware of the specifics of various left wing ideologies, modern \"communism\" has evolved because marx was proven so wrong that even commies can\\'t deny it anymore. i\\'m too tired to type up the specifics, read the perestroika deception. commie in the sense i use it in casual conversation with reddit tourists is a catchall for commies, social democrats etc etc. that being said, i don\\'t care which brand of leftist someone is, they all go on the train because they pose a constant threat to my freedom and property rights. this has all happened before. anyone paying attention can see history repeating itself. after this is weimar, after that is fascism. it will get worse before it gets better. there\\'s so much disinfo and subversion on there, it\\'s insane. it\\'s obvious by now that this subreddit was actually made to subvert any pro-worker movements to just be another pozzed gay shitfest pick my cotton this is actually what they think they\\'ll be doing lmao kek didn\\'t realize it was that impressive projection, how much did you lose? race is everything. the only people who don\\'t think so are white leftists, and they\\'re all mentally ill. yes everyone is just like how you say it. you really do have a mental illness. no wonder nothing ever gets fucking solved. almost nobody works for minimum wage but a pretty good amount of people do work for minimum wage plus the cent raise they got for the year. most of these low paying jobs avoid being put on the \"minimum wage\" statistics by offering competitive raises of around cents for every year you work for them so you\\'re not technically getting minimum wage. communism cope. ape in now boys. a modernity constructed to line the pockets of anglo ristocrats to the detriment of all mankind based reichs mark poster. lol tldr. oh yeah let me get /biz/ take on this. hell yeah so you\\'re like blm? cringe as fuck their original request of \"$-$ an hour and guaranteed weeks of pto\" was not only fair but should\\'ve been the standard. now they have insane requests of $ an hour, months pto, free healthcare plus dental, and a bunch of other bullshit that is just obviously manufactured division between them by shekelstein. i\\'m highly allergic to bees but birds are nice enough to fill in for me what happened to $k is conservative, $k eth is possible you cocksucker? would i be able to make enough profit, if pay hire a voice over actor, a writer, an animator, and i would do the editing i would do normies targeted videos on history, pseudo science, economy. we are still pumping downwards guys. no curry, i just had some roasted broccoli. you? heeeeeeeeeeeeeeelp based literally me anyway, i posted this on /beg/ a few days ago and it wasn\\'t told to kms so i consider that a win although it\\'s far from good. not gonna quit my day job anytime soon but it was fun to draw some mma girl and make her look like kevin from ed edd n eddy i want to see yhwh driven to whore herself off for a single icp worth us cents how\\'s it going vihaan? is your village shitting, starving, or both? dogecoin and shiba inu are puppy dogs compared to the big dog dogelon mars what are the best upcoming alt coins? imagine watching her getting gangbanged by bbc none... we\\'re going down. hype is over. question is, will we crab for a while between k-k, or damp? we\\'re in a year bear market at least. start looking for alts in webfour noooooooooooooooooo we\\'re all about to wake from this nightmare eventually... it\\'s okay to be wrong mumu. bobros need some love every now and then. just accept your analysis was wrong, take it as a learning experience and move on. shut the fuck up feeling anxious during corrections or when volatility is higher is a sign that you have overinvested. consider reducing your allocation into that coin or crypto in general till you\\'re comfortable risking more, or the market is less volatile. \\'tis just some advice fren. based milkerchads this thing is blasting to the moon and feeding many villages along the way milkers will flip catgirl coin ( billion ath, million currently) and it’s sitting at k rn. easy make it coin check my vital signs to know i\\'m still alive hahaha this is the dawning of the age of aquarius people making the claim that longs are over leveraged are wrong. look at the long/short ratio accounts .x accounts holding long to short is within a healthy range. this is the same ratio we had in july. increase in oi with a healthy long/short ratio tells me retail is shorting, exchanges, whales and smart money are on the other side of the trade. as long as we dont break the unbreakable .k or .k we still crab https://twitter.com/c_varley/status /?s= its the chosen coin isn\\'t it?! we\\'re back on track! take this generic whore as a gift at which stage are we? kek, hello laggards and thanks for buying my baggards do yourself a favor and flee as fast as you can. fixed it realistically, probably right smack in the middle of it. buy xmr i say early majority. this does not mean price has hit a peak however. for all you imbeciles who cant understand the difference between adoption and price, understand this: the internet adoption growth rate hit a peak somewhere in the late s. the dotcom bubble top happened in . crypto is not yet fully adopted. we still have several years before this shit is actually used in real life to store vaccination records, facilitate every day payments, execute wills via smart contract, etc. after this full adoption happens, we will have a mega blow-off top bubble. tldr. we are still early, but not as early as the bogs yea idk about that chief. im not opposed to the possiblility of btc becoming digital gold like the maxis proclaim, but the real innovation is going to happen elsewhere. btc will forever stay in the top but you cant deny there are superior coins. i have $k in link what do? x\\'ers pass you by everyday, but you will never obtain one because you refuse to let go of link. bros i remembered a dream last night and had a seed phrase on it, it was in bip i am fairly sure and it had bitcoin on it. however there are a few gaps in my dream. if you can solve it congratulations i cannot i will be posting them here. the ones with the question mark are where the gaps are because i thought that\\'s what they were however i am not sure. i think that was how many there were if i can\\'t work it out i want someone to make it from the dream i had. good luck bros. you\\'ve got your stack correct? o yes. i came for the nwo meme, invested for the math and will be holding for god and my kids. maybe im wrong but as of now this is my gamble that i believe will offer me the most stable and fruitful returns for decades to come. my life is unironically in your hands leemon. i wonder which floydie got them banned ... hmm. that twitter account randomly followed me a few days ago a real man buys nigerian princes most are $ right now, get one before they\\'re $k each i tuned into crypto night in america on cnbc. an hour special on crypto. all facets of crypto were mentioned, except link. sol, ada, eth, mana, xtz, you name anything in the top , it was mentioned. except for chainlink. i am beginning to believe cope. linkmarines, asseeemmmmbbbllllleeeeee!!!!!! we. are. holding. link could go to $, $, $, all the way to fucking zero, and we still will never sell, do you hear me!?! bulgarians can\\'t make us sell. finns can\\'t make us sell. trannies and chinks can\\'t make us sell. we are the linkmarines, and we are never fucking selling!! chhhhhaaaaaaarrrrrggggggeeeeee!!! for seerrrgaaaayyyyyy!!!!!!!! thanks for this, zeus capital, seriously it is always darkest before sunrise. gives out one of the highest stablecoin roi\\'s known to man at % near riskless. why are you pretending it\\'s all over? bear trap. us crabs are getting rich on this dank horizontal movement. poor verticalfags losing everything. based crabbro. let\\'s get on a seesaw together later and never ever get off? ahahahahahahahha i would give all my ftm to bring her back bros... ive made so much money but as what cost? are you retarded? any promising low mc shitcoins that launched recently? s i barely feel anything. i am gonna be pretty bummed if the bull run is over though. i bought , dusk tokens a year ago. am i going to make it? if i own apple stock shouldn\\'t i get a cut of all sales first of all, i am sincerely asking the few of you with actual high iq, since i know where my limitations are. so fuck you ahead of time if you think i am shilling one way or another. i was about to invest a substantial amount into oasis after sifting through weeks of bullshit. then i started looking into dusk and it seems to adhere to the whole \\'private data\\' paradigm but on a blockchain level. why would i stick with oasis vs dusk as a play? dusk sba &gt; basic oasis pos i own k rose and k dusk, what\\'s my outlook? i\\'ll never forgive the chainlinkers for the evil they have wrought on this world hodl b cmc yw bce.wtf/ only project i bought that didnt rug on me it\\'s already recovering nice try fag why didn\\'t you sell at k so you could buy back lower? i did but then i fomod back in like days later taxes. just lmao rich people and poor people both smoke indoors. middleclass people smoke outside in the rain. funny how that works. middleclass neurosis detected. assumed smoking means cigarettes only because he has no class. but if a lady wants to smoke cigarettes indoors it’s not a problem if you dgaf (poor) or are secure in a generational abode (rich). only the cookie cutter zillow croud worry about “re-sale value.” that’s very deep why don’t you put it in a pic of a mountain and fuck off back to r*ddit where they’ll appreciate your genius i\\'m buying geo (private prisons) tomorrow and i don\\'t feel at all guilty. because i\\'m cool as ice. oh chinks. i\\'ll be buying your bags on dec. no refunds. we\\'re about to pump so hard bros % icp portfolio % icp portfolio i unironically thought i was the only one absolutely based is this reportable under begging? there is a reason why smartcontracts.org leads you to dfinity and smartcontract.com leads you to chainlinklabs. icp and link tokens are probably the biggest wealth creation opportunities in the world right now. this technology, combined with automation and artificial intelligence (imagine a general a.i running on a decentralized, nuclear resistant internet being fed all the infomation humanity produces by chainlink nodes. basically god.) basically makes the middle class superfluous. this is a massive saving for the super rich. all that is needed from base level humanity is to be integrated directly with ai via neurallink and related technologies, to be put into the \\'metaverse\\' and permanently entertained and boom. the elites have control of the entire planets resources. based brother. let\\'s do this i have locked up years. using the interest as profits satoshi (dr craig wright, genius, iq with seventeen degrees) isn\\'t going to just crash btc to zero overnight. he is going to bleed you slowly over to fund his projects on the real bitcoin (bsv, protected with thousands of patents, the original bit coin) every time you think the price has recovered he is going to dump a little bit more. so go ahead and keep buying btc as you\\'re just donating to satoshi nakamoto! such a genius that his shitcoin has slid from top two years ago into the # slot (and still plummeting). one of the only coins to avoid the - bull run entirely. how about you get back to us once he\\'s able to sign the keys and prove he\\'s satoshi? bsv is a shitcoin, and cra*g is a conman what a faggot there\\'s a storm coming, and we\\'re in the middle of it...... go inside retard get dot tards!!!! why arent you buying bitcoin literally just buy it just fucking buy bitcoin you poor. tell your friends and family to buy even if its a small amount, if we all buy bitcoin its going to go up. and remember hodl if you sell youre a poor.youre literally going to buy the future of finance youre literally buying a revolution. do you wanna do some good for once in this world you worthless poor just buy bitcoin! don\\'t worry, i\\'ll buy when it\\'s under $k. i told you this garbage was overpriced, you didn\\'t listen. i\\'m accoomulating bitcoin cash which is x cheaper and with x more utility. sorry, % of my portfolio is in icp faggot who else comfy bondbros do you cough sperm? you could be a billionaire like sam. also i made this pepe you didn\\'t short the bottom did you? alien fud incoming see you at k obviously avax had to pre-dump for supposedly \"no reason\" days before btc started acting like a shitcoin, now their swing bots will make sure they milk the most out of it the monk bought lunch! also i made this pepe also i made these pepes also i made this pepe liar. i made this pepe. here’s proof yes, that\\'s a very rare pepe, you should make it an nft do you guys have any nft certif to prove your claims or we\\'ll see it in court? /biz/ has literally no argument against this. kys op. socialism is a corrupt system where the people in power tell the peasants that they don\\'t need any wealth but hoard it for themselves. he looks like this america is already socialist what\\'s the difference between coke and pepsi? let\\'s not bother debating theoretical definitions that you can read up on wikipedia. any attempt at either resulted in the same outcome... over many continents and many cultures. not that objective evidence will change your mind, your commie brain will defend this ideology tooth and nail. imagine not having a milly picrel the actual quote the only people who unironically dislike capitalism are poor midwits or nepotism kids the context really changes the emphasis. i\\'m neither enemy nor friend. i am back from a world where such words are meaningless. i\\'ve removed all obstacles. now you and i will battle to the death. i\\'ve waited a long time for this day. now i want to to enjoy the moment. i\\'ve come from another world to do battle with you. a fight to the death with you. only in that can my soul find respite. i will kill you or you will kill me... it makes no difference. now, anon, make me feel alive again. gray bobro..... also i made this pepe the birdsnbees are shaggin in the trees you\\'re refusing to engage in an intelligent activity known as \"cutting one\\'s losses\" foolish greedy mumus, they still think it\\'s in a bullrun but they have

epicredditdogocoinifuckedmymother and become am millionaire. is crypto about to have a dot com bubble moment? i mean, there\\'s no way they\\'ll allow normies to make it, right? i already cashed out when i saw these sell signals so fuck it, kill them all with this castrophic crash. the bull run can’t be over, right? this is retarded there will be full layer one evm and ethereum smart contract support in the first phase. the nevm reach up to million tps, beats bsc. basically combines best of eth with best of btc without the insane fees. actually useful and not the latest shitcoin you guys seeing the trainwreck that is the shib ama right now? i think this is a serious issue most people should be aware of when buying pos coins. here\\'s where i run out of information: which networks are vulnerable to this, in that they don\\'t limit validator stake, and that stake is proportional to block producing probability? i\\'d like to gather a list and make some sort of recurring thread to help myself and others stay away from vulnerable chains. i\\'m thinking to call it \"short attack general\", but am open to better names. i sold it all i either made the best or worst decision of my life. i am never buying a coin mentioned on /biz/ again support at . seems to be holding it\\'s over for the bulls. nexo offers the best apy! change my mind. i get it, i\\'m missing gains being a poor fag. shitcoins outperform but i don\\'t care. i\\'m not smart enough to time the market or know what\\'s going to moon at launch but i am smart enough to dyor and all three of these are genuinely useful. i see them as the google apple amazon of the crypto bubble. the ones that actually make it long term once regulations hit. when you invest right charts are just numbers and a light show. how would i go about finding out if one market (asia, europe, usa) is responsible for consistently dumping minute over minute, or day after day? i have a hunch the asian markets are responsible for a lot of the recent bitcoin and crypto related dumps. is there an economic boom occurring in the south? what is the cause of this migration? is it weird to normies that i do this? i don’t think i’m doing anything wrong and bitcoin will be there to bring you to the moon why do wagies gossip like high schooler? no amount of gains will bring her back. your pump has failed. down to zero you go lmao. shibagholders shibagholding shibags forever hahhahahahaha hasn\\'t. even. fucking. started. i wonder what you get when you combine a shiba and a ninja wat mean? you seller guys are fucking stupid. why? simple because mtv mainnet is just months old and you shitting your pants. you don’t wanna know what’s going to happen when usecases come out. the team are legends. dont dyor. trust me. and when it’s $+ you buy again. even if you sold at .~ crypto isn’t new anymore use your brains. if you have to buy something tomorrow and you’ve got no money. okay i understand. but if you don’t need it. just

Physically obviously not. desperate You don\\'t stop to ask a violent aggressor why he\\'s going to stab you, you just put them down. This guy. It\\'s pretty easy to manipulate a literal child into doing stupid shit, anon. I realize I\\'m one man and I can\\'t get caught up and think about all the evil shit in this world, but at least I can recognize it. There is no trial. The justice system only applies to niggers and NW less than $m But with blacks they will bend Also I fucking hate women as much as the next guy, but leave kids alone, it\\'s not that hard is it, pedo? The politicians are gay Checked and extremely based. kek fucking hell kys pedo Incredibly based Algorand is an ISO project that converges decentralized and traditional finance by enabling the simple creation of next generation financial products, protocols and exchange of value. holders receive .% APY and can commit their tokens during governance periods, until all tokens are unlocked by . It\\'s a superhighway under construction to handle everything from stable coins to credit card transactions to any number of apps at extreme transactions per second. Backed by an MIT brain trust and father of cryptography and they are on friendly terms with the SEC. https://pastebin.com/vykeC boomp eet I hate dips. How am I gonna survive the second bear market? pain Avoid Tiny man. Its always pajeets running each other for dollar profits I wanna back the truck with a few thousand algoys. If you can handle the pain. It\\'s not for everyone. I follow the twitter to keep my resolve during these unprecedented times Yieldly is splitting their token for iYLDY. Slippery slope imo. They are going to keep taking future utility away from YDLY Captcha: VGGY Boys we are having a modest pump away from king shitcoin. what are peoples thoughts on birdbot? Is this going to be another planets esque investment? Of course. Quick, make a wish before ze doomp! I\\'m still holding the belief that GEMS are being manipulated and something big is going to happen when the time is right HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA OHHH LINKIES I sold some algo while it was pumping because bitcoin was dumping. Why doesn\\'t it stop pumping. Blapu is making a comeback, liquidity increasing, dev applied to verify and it seems they finally hired someone to make a logo. Not to mention its everywhere on Algogems atm. https://youtu.be/OobuoMtos This, it\\'s so new there are very few who know how to code in it. You\\'re probably better off learning it yourself and then hiring a team. Tbots dev is not really an option since he has his own project and is dedicated mostly to his Phd if he is to be believed. Paradigm SHIFT! Are we going to see dollars again or is everyone going to redeem their governance and dump the market? They keep following &amp; get followed back by all the big Algo NFT names. Tin hat but I think the wait will be over soon gemsbros I NEED MY CHEAP ALGOS I feel sick, very sick. Im starting to see every fucking normie in my life get into crypto. Was never like this before, even years ago. Now every faggot thinks they can buy epicredditdogocoinIfuckedmymother and become am millionaire. Is Crypto about to have a dot com bubble moment? I mean, there\\'s no way they\\'ll allow normies to make it, right? I already cashed out when I saw these sell signals so fuck it, kill them all with this castrophic crash. lads, he sold. WAAGMI I’m a full time landlord who day trades for fun, no I wouldn’t touch crypto with a ft pole (total Ponzi scheme).... I had some stupid bitch (who I suspect is a plebbitor) back in September telling me how I needed to go all in on shiba and how she would be purchasing one of my unit apartment complexes after shiba mooned.... That was the most bearish sell signal I could ever imagine some bitch who drops by my office to pay her rent telling me she would be purchasing the complex she lives off her crypto gains entering? This was the top and I cannot believe I didn’t sell right then and there. After all these idiots like your bitch tenant have bought shitcoin, who\\'s left to prop the ponzi? The bull run can’t be over, right? This is retarded the bull run is over, khhv neets blew the entire $ grandma gave them for xmas on bitcoin, now it\\'s a long ride down to k. there will be full Layer One EVM and Ethereum smart contract support in the first phase. THE NEVM reach up to million TPS, beats bsc. Basically combines best of ETH with best of BTC without the insane fees. actually useful and not the latest shitcoin You guys seeing the trainwreck that is the SHIB ama right now? at least its bringing out the beggars SIRS I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PROFIT they mad Thank you kumar, very cool! you WILL be happy I think this is a serious issue most people should be aware of when buying PoS coins. Here\\'s where I run out of information: which networks are vulnerable to this, in that they don\\'t limit validator stake, and that stake is proportional to block producing probability? I\\'d like to gather a list and make some sort of recurring thread to help myself and others stay away from vulnerable chains. I\\'m thinking to call it \"Short Attack General\", but am open to better names. bumping with booba pls answer I sold it all I either made the best or worst decision of my life. I am never buying a coin mentioned on /biz/ again Bitcoin wait did they actually claim that? OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Same. For me it\\'s the ICP acoooomulators like In the end, it was fucking ICP holders posting their \"We\\'re probably going lower\" that got me. Pump it now that I\\'m out, or keep dumping, I don\\'t care. My AVAX, RUNE, ETH, EGLD, and LUNA bags are all comfy, but this hold has been busting my balls for months and I\\'m not doing this anymore. Lmao unless you bought those for peanuts then I dont know what to say to you, probably low iq. I\\'m not saying go all in, but im saying you should be funneling shitcoins into ICP as you make money off garbage. A- a-anon i thought u knew that its only gonne get lower? thanks for playing \"investors\" HAHAHHHHHAA I know bro just look at this chart Scam confirmed Based ignore the seething baggies, now they need another idiot to get them where they were kek he\\'s bussy recording, I mean writing his next crypto munmail, I hear he was bullish on FLUX and LU-XY ever since dominic went cold on him support at . seems to be holding next stop: federal fuck-me-in-the-ass prison I just watched meet the kevin interview with richard heart, why is he so annoying? using not-so-clever semantics (\"sacrifice\" lol) in an attempt to fool the SEC only makes it a worse crime noooo daddy SEC come get Richard and pwut him in jayooo. I don\\'t like him and I don\\'t have any money because I didn\\'t invest in Hex. get a grip you little pussy. you know nothing about securities laws. have fun staying poor Go back shilling dog clones here or on plebbit, maybe that´s the only thing you can get done right. Oh shit, the boys with the blue ID´s are on the lookout for scams. Hexicans, it´s over! At this point i somehow have to admit that i miss the days with frequent shitposting namefags. I checked the other threads and there was currently no entertainment in them or they were rugs where i would never buy a bag again. pic unrelated Would passing the ct line be valid breakout? That´s just wrong. All of it! First of all the biggest part of the current uptrend is the incoming pulsex sacrifice, which also profits hex price. Second fact is that i have not one but to dads. Nigger caught red handed with ebonics. Nice try Jamal, stop projecting and no your dad is never coming back from that \"quick run to grab dem smokes yo\". Not in an active way as far as i know. You passively pump the price of hex which is good for bagholders and maybe also yourself, if you keep some. Make fucking sure you sacrifice from your own wallet, not from an exchange, if you want to sac at all. lets marky mark this shit biz bros also where are you other hex niggas? I prefer shitposting instead of spoonfeeding. OH FUCK, IT´S GO TIME! Freemasons assemble, the sac phase has been kicked off. I only bought this coin because I knew there was going to be an unlimited amount of retards on this earth who would buy the coin and stake it for years I´m so fucking hyped. This will become history. I bet k USD that Carlos Matos is having a ghost boner right now without knowing what´s going on. word plsx sac is live hex mooning. feels good There´s more going on. You may be really dumb but you ´re lucky enough to come to the right place at the right time. you have no idea how lucky you are. are you going to listen to WEAK fud like a retard or to the smartest man in the game RH? tick..tock goy you had years My Year old dad put k into this shit now going onto pulseX He trying to get me into it but getting real bad fucking vibes from Richard Heart. I hope to god he doesn\\'t get rugged ill personally hunt down and kill that fucking cunt in minecraft stop being poor. OOOO CENT HEX NOW, I bet jannies have stakes sac\\'ing hex is a really stupid idea if you own tshares, you idiots are not burning tokens you are giving them away to be sold for an airdrop. just buy eth and let that get dumped on That\\'s . million sacrificed in one swing It\\'s over for the bulls. Nexo offers the best APY! Change my mind. THIS IS A PAID SHILL THREAD DONT FALL FOR IT I get it, I\\'m missing gains being a poor fag. Shitcoins outperform but I don\\'t care. I\\'m not smart enough to time the market or know what\\'s going to moon at launch but I am smart enough to dyor and all three of these are genuinely useful. I see them as the Google Apple Amazon of the crypto bubble. The ones that actually make it long term once regulations hit. When you invest right charts are just numbers and a light show. fuck your avatars long live the baker Ken Griffin, you have yil thread theme: tomorrow at am MOASS starts. WAGMI frens.

Ignore them and get comfy, fren luggy sebens! :DD:DDDD:DD i declare that everyone in this thread is a faggot and it is imperative you all take your meds negative yes anon, please see picrel for supporting sources Holding GME is like holding bitcoin back when it was $ for one. I don’t care about adoption or real world use. I don’t know who satoshi is and I don’t care. All I know is that Wall St and banks are scared and they don’t want me to have it. They turn off the buy button. They take out ads to say they covered. They go on CNBC and say it’s overvalued. They say to sell and buy AMC. They pay Indians to infest these boards to spread lies and fear. Happy new year and WAGMI. for some there truly is no exit soon more weeks! I know the feeling. I remember someone told me to buy bitcoin at $. I waited and bought at $. Glad I waited, why would I want something worth $ when I could have it worth $?

Digital tokens don\\'t really interest me ill start dcaing at k very convincing thesis. I revise my target and I too will not buy any over k adamus-predictions-/ How are we feeling? I still think this coin has potential despite the sideways movement. If you think this coin has a future, post in this bread The shit they did to the site was pretty based, but the price is stagnant. Though I guess that\\'s not the worst thing rn seeing as how everything is fucking dying The BTC chart is drawing a \"L\" just like the losers you are. FlokiEVE Not too late Brobinos Will BTC be bussin bussin or sussin sussin in fr fr that pepes deadass buss bussin it seems that most people aren\\'t actually anti work but just want more bucks an hour. a few fringe morons want a \"world without work\" but largely its just fast food wagies realizing how poor they are. first of all, i hate fast food. second of all, how do i profit? i browsed the shithole a few times , had some chuckles got bored after a while. I think its funny that they think they aren\\'t replaceable and that they think they are actually hurting the corporations pockets. This is the biggest burger cope i ever witnessed LU-XY is the next big thing in crypto and is becoming the go to place for the best NFT Lu-xy_io is making the best NFT platform available for everyone Lu-xy_io is built to be multichain, starting with the Polygon blockchain allowing it to be fast, scalable, green, low cost, and user-friendly. Are you actually a retard? Lu-xy_io is designed to offer a new and much improved NFT market place experience. that sounds fine to me We work towards freedom, they just bitch about it. It worked didn\\'t it? How\\'s sitting at home complaining about rich people working for you? I studied investments and made the right calls. Not the same as flashing your tits. Either way, I never have to work again. Isn\\'t that the point of your commie circlejerk? Who\\'s really the idiot here? imagine actually thinking - is a normal work day. so glad i\\'m in a job where i can leave at pm and have the rest of the day for me and my family You know thots say they\\'re just meeting market demands, right? Throwing out econ terms does not make you smart lmao shut the fuck up and get me my tendies and fries wagie scum, or I\\'ll send a complaint email to HR and have you fired. So poor kek. chad employer Poorfag BTFO, back to work wagie. NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! WORKERS CAN\\'T DEMAND THINGS FROM THEIR EMPLOYERS, IT CAN ONLY BE THE OTHER WAY AROUND!!!!!!!!!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fixed it BTW, these people are seething nocoiners. Ahem, this is /biz/, we have always been a pro-work board as this is for BUSINESS and finance. He\\'s right. They\\'ll never stop. If you aren\\'t happy with your wage, get a better job. Most wagies deserve a $ an hour pay cut for the shit job they do. I am. I want to tip my boss more,and fund my extra education/training. Not projecting, I\\'ve been a boss before and none of you wagies even deserve a lunch break. Isn\\'t it time for bed wagie? Work tomorrow and you need to be fresh and ready for your boss. the cold war ended in why are you obsessed with communism given that most people who shout that word don\\'t even know what it means? you come off like someone who repeats what they hear off their dad\\'s cable news broadcasts lol lmao historically retarded. Revolution when? Gets co-opted by glowies who distract the retarded commies from the real (((problem))) and gets them yelling at white people and simping for minorities and women? What a delicious bait alright back to work now wagies. my chicken tender plate isn\\'t going to materialize itself Most of them are actually just retarded from all the corn syrup and chemicals in the water. This time last year I had exactly zero dollars and had to go to my parents\\' house every day for dinner. The money I invested didn\\'t grow on trees and I got where I am without a job. They could be free from work if they had a brain, they just can\\'t / won\\'t accept they\\'re the unwashed masses and don\\'t have the IQ to make it. I\\'m well aware of the specifics of various left wing ideologies, modern \"communism\" has evolved because Marx was proven so wrong that even commies can\\'t deny it anymore. I\\'m too tired to type up the specifics, read the perestroika deception. Commie in the sense I use it in casual conversation with reddit tourists is a catchall for commies, social democrats etc etc. That being said, I don\\'t care which brand of leftist someone is, they all go on the train because they pose a constant threat to my freedom and property rights. This has all happened before. Anyone paying attention can see history repeating itself. After this is Weimar, after that is Fascism. It will get worse before it gets better. There\\'s so much disinfo and subversion on there, it\\'s insane. it\\'s obvious by now that this subreddit was actually made to subvert any pro-worker movements to just be another pozzed gay shitfest Pick my cotton This is actually what they think they\\'ll be doing lmao KEK Didn\\'t realize it was that impressive Projection, how much did you lose? Race is everything. The only people who don\\'t think so are white leftists, and they\\'re all mentally ill. yes everyone is just like how you say it. You really do have a mental illness. No wonder nothing ever gets fucking solved. Almost nobody works for minimum wage but a pretty good amount of people do work for minimum wage plus the cent raise they got for the year. Most of these low paying jobs avoid being put on the \"minimum wage\" statistics by offering competitive raises of around cents for every year you work for them so you\\'re not technically getting minimum wage. Communism Cope. Ape in now boys. A modernity constructed to line the pockets of Anglo Ristocrats to the detriment of all mankind Based Reichs Mark poster. LOL tldr. Oh yeah let me get /biz/ take on this. HELL YEAH So you\\'re like BLM? cringe as fuck Their original request of \"$-$ an hour and guaranteed weeks of pto\" was not only fair but should\\'ve been the standard. Now they have insane requests of $ an hour, months pto, free healthcare plus dental, and a bunch of other bullshit that is just obviously manufactured division between them by Shekelstein. I\\'m highly allergic to bees But birds are nice enough to fill in for me WHAT HAPPENED TO $K IS CONSERVATIVE, $K ETH IS POSSIBLE YOU COCKSUCKER? would I be able to make enough profit, if pay hire a voice over actor, a writer, an animator, and I would do the editing I would do normies targeted videos on history, pseudo science, economy. We are still pumping downwards guys. No curry, I just had some roasted broccoli. You? HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELP based literally me Anyway, i posted this on /beg/ a few days ago and it wasn\\'t told to kms so I consider that a win although it\\'s far from good. not gonna quit my day job anytime soon but it was fun to draw some MMA girl and make her look like Kevin from Ed edd n eddy i want to see yhwh driven to whore herself off for a single icp worth us cents How\\'s it going Vihaan? Is your village shitting, starving, or both? dogecoin and shiba inu are puppy dogs compared to the big dog Dogelon Mars What are the best upcoming alt coins? Imagine watching her getting gangbanged by BBC None... We\\'re going down. Hype is over. Question is, will we crab for a while between k-k, or damp? We\\'re in a year bear market at least. Start looking for alts in Webfour NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO we\\'re all about to wake from this nightmare eventually... It\\'s okay to be wrong mumu. Bobros need some love every now and then. Just accept your analysis was wrong, take it as a learning experience and move on. SHUT THE FUCK UP Feeling anxious during corrections or when volatility is higher is a sign that you have overinvested. Consider reducing your allocation into that coin or crypto in general till you\\'re comfortable risking more, or the market is less volatile. \\'Tis just some advice fren. based milkerchads this thing is blasting to the moon and feeding many villages along the way Milkers will flip catgirl coin ( billion ath, million currently) and it’s sitting at k rn. Easy make it coin CHECK MY VITAL SIGNS TO KNOW I\\'M STILL ALIVE hahaha THIS IS THE DAWNING OF THE AGE OF AQUARIUS People making the claim that longs are over leveraged are wrong. Look at the long/short ratio accounts .x accounts holding long to short is within a healthy range. This is the same ratio we had in July. Increase in OI with a healthy long/short ratio tells me retail is shorting, exchanges, whales and smart money are on the other side of the trade. As long as we dont break the unbreakable .k or .k we still crab https://twitter.com/c_varley/status /?s= ITS THE CHOSEN COIN ISN\\'T IT?! we\\'re back on track! take this generic whore as a gift At which stage are we? kek, hello laggards and thanks for buying my baggards Do yourself a favor and flee as fast as you can. fixed it Realistically, probably right smack in the middle of it. buy XMR I say early majority. This does not mean price has hit a peak however. For all you imbeciles who cant understand the difference between adoption and price, understand this: The internet adoption growth rate hit a peak somewhere in the late s. The dotcom bubble top happened in . Crypto is not yet fully adopted. We still have several years before this shit is actually used in real life to store vaccination records, facilitate every day payments, execute wills via smart contract, etc. After this full adoption happens, we will have a mega blow-off top bubble. tldr. we are still early, but not as early as the Bogs Yea idk about that chief. Im not opposed to the possiblility of BTC becoming digital gold like the maxis proclaim, but the real innovation is going to happen elsewhere. BTC will forever stay in the top but you cant deny there are superior coins. I have $k in LINK WHAT do? x\\'ers pass you by everyday, but you will never obtain one because you refuse to let go of LINK. Bros I remembered a dream last night and had a seed phrase on it, it was in BIP I am fairly sure and it had Bitcoin on it. However there are a few gaps in my dream. If you can solve it congratulations I cannot I will be posting them here. The ones with the question mark are where the gaps are because I thought that\\'s what they were however I am not sure. I think that was how many there were if I can\\'t work it out I want someone to make it from the dream I had. Good luck bros. You\\'ve got your stack correct? O Yes. I came for the NWO meme, invested for the math and will be holding for God and my kids. Maybe im wrong but as of now this is my gamble that I believe will offer me the most stable and fruitful returns for decades to come. My life is unironically in your hands Leemon. I wonder which Floydie got them banned ... hmm. that twitter account randomly followed me a few days ago a real man buys Nigerian Princes most are $ right now, get one before they\\'re $k each I tuned into crypto night in America on CNBC. An hour special on crypto. All facets of crypto were mentioned, except LINK. SOL, ADA, ETH, MANA, XTZ, you name anything in the top , it was mentioned. Except for Chainlink. I am beginning to believe Cope. LINKMARINES, ASSEEEMMMMBBBLLLLLEEEEEE!!!!!! WE. ARE. HOLDING. LINK could go to $, $, $, all the way to fucking zero, and we STILL will NEVER sell, do you hear me!?! Bulgarians can\\'t make us sell. Finns can\\'t make us sell. Trannies and chinks can\\'t make us sell. WE ARE THE LINKMARINES, AND WE ARE NEVER FUCKING SELLING!! CHHHHHAAAAAAARRRRRGGGGGGEEEEEE!!! FOR SEERRRGAAAAYYYYYY!!!!!!!! thanks for this, zeus capital, seriously It is always darkest before sunrise. Gives out one of the highest stablecoin ROI\\'s known to man at % near riskless. why are you pretending it\\'s all over? Bear trap. Us crabs are getting rich on this dank horizontal movement. Poor verticalfags losing everything. Based crabbro. Let\\'s get on a seesaw together later and never ever get off? AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA I would give all my FTM to bring her back bros... Ive made so much money but as what cost? are you retarded? Any promising low MC shitcoins that launched recently? S I barely feel anything. I am gonna be pretty bummed if the bull run is over though. I bought , Dusk tokens a year ago. Am I going to make it? if I own apple stock shouldn\\'t i get a cut of all sales first of all, I am sincerely asking the few of you with actual high IQ, since I know where my limitations are. So fuck you ahead of time if you think I am shilling one way or another. I was about to invest a substantial amount into Oasis after sifting through weeks of bullshit. Then I started looking into DUSK and it seems to adhere to the whole \\'private data\\' paradigm but on a blockchain level. Why would I stick with OASIS vs DUSK as a play? Dusk SBA &gt; Basic Oasis PoS I own k ROSE and k DUSK, what\\'s my outlook? i\\'ll never forgive the chainlinkers for the evil they have wrought on this world Hodl b cmc yw bce.wtf/ Only project i bought that didnt rug on me It\\'s already recovering Nice try fag why didn\\'t you sell at k so you could buy back lower? i did but then i fomod back in like days later TAXES. just lmao Rich people and poor people both smoke indoors. Middleclass people smoke outside in the rain. funny how that works. Middleclass neurosis detected. Assumed smoking means cigarettes only because he has no class. But if a lady wants to smoke cigarettes indoors it’s not a problem if you dgaf (poor) or are secure in a generational abode (rich). Only the cookie cutter Zillow croud worry about “re-sale value.” That’s very deep why don’t you put it in a pic of a mountain and fuck off back to r*ddit where they’ll appreciate your genius I\\'m buying GEO (private prisons) tomorrow and I don\\'t feel at all guilty. Because I\\'m cool as Ice. Oh chinks. I\\'ll be buying your bags on dec. No refunds. we\\'re about to pump so hard bros % ICP portfolio % ICP portfolio I unironically thought I was the only one absolutely based is this reportable under begging? There is a reason why smartcontracts.org leads you to Dfinity and Smartcontract.com leads you to chainlinklabs. ICP and LINK tokens are probably the biggest wealth creation opportunities in the world right now. This technology, combined with automation and Artificial intelligence (imagine a general A.I running on a decentralized, nuclear resistant internet being fed all the infomation humanity produces by Chainlink nodes. Basically god.) basically makes the middle class superfluous. This is a MASSIVE saving for the super rich. All that is needed from base level humanity is to be integrated directly with AI via neurallink and related technologies, to be put into the \\'metaverse\\' and permanently entertained and boom. The elites have control of the entire planets resources. based brother. let\\'s do this I have locked up years. Using the interest as profits Satoshi (Dr Craig Wright, genius, IQ with SEVENTEEN degrees) isn\\'t going to just crash BTC to zero overnight. He is going to bleed you slowly over to fund his projects on the REAL Bitcoin (BSV, protected with thousands of patents, the original Bit Coin) Every time you think the price has recovered he is going to dump a little bit more. So go ahead and keep buying BTC as you\\'re just donating to Satoshi Nakamoto! Such a genius that his shitcoin has slid from top two years ago into the # slot (and still plummeting). One of the only coins to avoid the - bull run entirely. How about you get back to us once he\\'s able to sign the keys and prove he\\'s Satoshi? bsv is a shitcoin, and cra*g is a conman What a faggot there\\'s a storm coming, and we\\'re in the middle of it...... Go inside retard GET DOT TARDS!!!! Why arent you buying bitcoin literally just buy it just fucking buy bitcoin you poor. Tell your friends and family to buy even if its a small amount, if we all buy bitcoin its going to go up. And remember HODL if you sell youre a poor.Youre literally going to buy the future of finance youre literally buying a revolution. Do you wanna do some good for once in this world you worthless poor just buy bitcoin! Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll buy when it\\'s under $k. I told you this garbage was overpriced, you didn\\'t listen. I\\'m accoomulating Bitcoin Cash which is x cheaper and with x more utility. sorry, % of my portfolio is in ICP faggot Who else comfy bondbros Do you cough sperm? You could be a billionaire like Sam. Also I made this pepe you didn\\'t short the bottom did you? alien fud incoming see you at k Obviously AVAX had to pre-dump for supposedly \"no reason\" days before BTC started acting like a shitcoin, Now their swing bots will make sure they milk the most out of it THE MONK BOUGHT LUNCH!

Socialism is a corrupt system where the people in power tell the peasants that they don\\'t need any wealth but hoard it for themselves. he looks like this America is already socialist What\\'s the difference between coke and pepsi? Let\\'s not bother debating theoretical definitions that you can read up on Wikipedia. Any attempt at either resulted in the same outcome... over many continents and many cultures. Not that objective evidence will change your mind, your commie brain will defend this ideology tooth and nail. imagine not having a milly picrel the actual quote The only people who unironically dislike capitalism are poor midwits or nepotism kids The context really changes the emphasis.

I\\'m well aware of the specifics of various left wing ideologies, modern \"communism\" has evolved because Marx was proven so wrong that even commies can\\'t deny it anymore. I\\'m too tired to type up the specifics, read the perestroika deception. Commie in the sense I use it in casual conversation with reddit tourists is a catchall for commies, social democrats etc etc. That being said, I don\\'t care which brand of leftist someone is, they all go on the train because they pose a constant threat to my freedom and property rights. This has all happened before. Anyone paying attention can see history repeating itself. After this is Weimar, after that is Fascism. It will get worse before it gets better. There\\'s so much disinfo and subversion on there, it\\'s insane. it\\'s obvious by now that this subreddit was actually made to subvert any pro-worker movements to just be another pozzed gay fest Pick my cotton This is actually what they think they\\'ll be doing lmao KEK Didn\\'t realize it was that impressive Projection, how much did you lose? Race is everything. The only people who don\\'t think so are white leftists, and they\\'re all mentally ill. yes everyone is just like how you say it. You really do have a mental illness. No wonder nothing ever gets ing solved. Almost nobody works for minimum wage but a pretty good amount of people do work for minimum wage plus the cent raise they got for the year. Most of these low paying jobs avoid being put on the \"minimum wage\" statistics by offering compeive raises of around cents for every year you work for them so you\\'re not technically getting minimum wage.

This does not mean price has hit a peak however. For all you imbeciles who cant understand the difference between adoption and price, understand this: The internet adoption growth rate hit a peak somewhere in the late s. The dotcom bubble top happened in . Crypto is not yet fully adopted. We still have several years before this  is actually used in real life to store vaccination records, facilitate every day payments, execute wills via smart contract, etc. After this full adoption happens, we will have a mega blow-off top bubble. tldr. we are still early, but not as early as the Bogs Yea idk about that chief. Im not opposed to the possiblility of BTC becoming digital gold like the maxis proclaim, but the real innovation is going to happen elsewhere. BTC will forever stay in the top but you cant deny there are superior coins. I have $k in LINK WHAT do? x\\'ers p you by everyday, but you will never obtain one because you refuse to let go of LINK. Bros I remembered a dream last night and had a seed phrase on it, it was in BIP I am fairly sure and it had Bitcoin on it. However there are a few gaps in my dream. If you can solve it congratulations I cannot I will be posting them here. The ones with the question mark are where the gaps are because I thought that\\'s what they were however I am not sure. I think that was how many there were if I can\\'t work it out I want someone to make it from the dream I had. Good luck bros. You\\'ve got your stack correct? O Yes.
